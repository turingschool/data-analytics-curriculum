<h2 id="how-do-computers-find-each-other">How do computers find each other?</h2>

<p>We know that in the HTTP request/response cycle, there are two players. A client and a server. But how do these two devices know <strong>where</strong> to send their requests/responses?</p>

<p>When you send a letter to a friend, you have to specify their address. This address uniquely identifies your friend‚Äôs house in the world. Computers have a corresponding address called an <strong>IP Address</strong>. The IP address address uniquely identifies a device on the internet. IP stands for ‚ÄúInternet Protocol‚Äù. In order to find a computer anywhere in the world, all you need is its IP address, for example 142.811.0.1.</p>

<p>However, when you go to your web browser, you don‚Äôt type in ‚Äú142.811.0.1‚Äù, you type in ‚Äúgoogle.com‚Äù. So how does ‚Äúgoogle.com‚Äù become ‚Äú142.811.0.1‚Äù? The answer is DNS.</p>

<h2 id="dns">DNS</h2>

<p>DNS is the Domain Name System. It‚Äôs entire job is to take a domain, like google.com, and translate it to an IP address, like 142.811.0.1.</p>

<p>You can think of DNS as the phonebook of the internet.</p>

<h2 id="activity">Activity</h2>

<p>Research the steps of DNS and draw a diagram to illustrate it.</p>

<h2 id="why-so-many-steps">Why so many steps?</h2>

<p>As you found, there are several steps in a DNS lookup. Why?</p>

<p>The reason is that transmissions across the internet take time. The farther away a device is, the longer the transmission takes. The longer transmissions take, the slower web pages will load. The slower web pages load, the angrier people on the internet will be.</p>

<p>If we imagine that rather than several steps involving several servers, DNS included just one server that was located in Australia, all requests to the DNS from Australia would be very fast, whereas all requests from the western hemisphere would be very slow. So by having many servers, any step in the DNS process will send you to the closest possible server to reduce the distance.</p>

<h2 id="caching">Caching</h2>

<p>Another way DNS speeds up this whole process is with <strong>caching</strong>. Caching is when a device stores data locally so that future requests for that data can be served faster.</p>

<p>For example, your computer may cache the answer of 2 + 2 as 4. The next time you ask your computer what 2 + 2 is, rather than doing the computation, it will return the answer stored in its cache, which is 4. In this example, the cacluation of 2 + 2 is pretty simple, but you can see the benefits once the data we‚Äôre after becomes very expensive to compute.</p>

<p>In DNS, any step of the lookup process may be <strong>cached</strong>. This makes it so that a number of steps in the process can be skipped if the information needed is already in cache.</p>

<p>If DNS uses caching, what could be some potential problems if the IP address associated with out domain name needs to change?</p>
