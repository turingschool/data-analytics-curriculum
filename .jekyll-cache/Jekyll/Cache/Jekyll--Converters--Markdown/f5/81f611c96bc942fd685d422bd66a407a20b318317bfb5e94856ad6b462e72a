<h3 id="brainstorm-and-list-some-goals-for-open-source-work">Brainstorm and list some goals for open source work</h3>
<ul>
  <li>My motivation for contributing to open source is:
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. â€˜I want to learn production-level Rubyâ€™, â€˜I want to help a non-profit that I believe in like the Peace Corpsâ€™, â€˜I want DHH to notice meâ€™ etc</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I would like to work with the following tech:
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. â€˜I want to work in Ruby because Iâ€™m comfortable in itâ€™, â€˜I want to try and work on an electron projectâ€™</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="find-5-open-source-projects-that-fit-your-goals-above">Find 5 Open Source Projects that Fit Your Goals Above</h3>
<p>List each project with a link to the repo</p>

<p>Resources:
    - https://github.com/explore
    - http://24pullrequests.com
    - Turing Mentors - many of them maintain or contribute to open source
    - Turing has some open source projects, like <code class="highlighter-rouge">LookingFor</code>, for exampleâ€¦
    - Look up the github pages for jobs you plan to apply to
    - Think about gems or npm libraries that you use often</p>

<h3 id="per-project-answer-the-following-questions">Per Project, answer the following questions:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Is this library well maintained?</li>
  <li>Look at things like the last merged commit, the number of open pull requests that havenâ€™t been mergedâ€¦ etc.</li>
  <li>Does this library look easy to get running locally?
    <ul>
      <li>Do they have instructions in the README to contribute or run locally?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Where would I get started finding something to work on?
    <ul>
      <li>Are there open issues that havenâ€™t been claimed?</li>
      <li>Is it clear who the maintainer is, so that I can contact them?</li>
      <li>If Iâ€™m familiar with the library, is there anything I wish was included in the documentation that I could add?</li>
      <li>Does the library have some form of Code Coverage or are there some edge cases that might not be tested that I could add testing for?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="get-up-and-running">Get Up and Running</h3>

<p>Once you have profiled 5 libraries, pick 2 or 3 that seem friendly, fork them, clone them down locally and <em>try</em> to get them running.</p>

<p>Per Forked Application:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Did you get the application running locally?
    <ul>
      <li>If not, where did you stop in the process and why?</li>
      <li>If yes, did you find anything you needed to do to run the app locally that wasnâ€™t in the README/instructions? Do you think you can put in a PR to add that?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>

<p>Spend some time over the next few days working on understanding and contributing to one of the open source libraries you profiled above. Try to dig into the codebase and understand small pieces. Compare the way the library tests to testing styles youâ€™ve seen before. Try and work on small fixes or features.</p>
