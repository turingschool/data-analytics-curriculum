<h3 id="professional-development-in-module-three">Professional Development in Module Three</h3>
<p>This is the first of your PD sessions this module. Module Three is the module in which the personal development of the previous two modules is applied to job searching and discovering the right path for your new career. You’ll leave Module Three with a clear blueprint for your job search, and we’ll start by first identifying what it is that you want out of your new career, telling that story clearly, and reflecting on how your strengths apply to finding this new, fulfilling career path.</p>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>

<h3 id="opening">Opening</h3>
<p>We’ve talked about your professional story before, and this will continue to be the cornerstone of your professional development. From your professional story, we’ll craft your resume, your Turing portfolio, update your LinkedIn, inspire others through blog posts, personal websites, projects, and more.</p>

<p>We are all inherent storytellers, and the aim of today’s session is to expand on your professional story and turn it into a compelling narrative.</p>

<h3 id="telling-your-story">Telling Your Story</h3>
<p>Our lives are made up of stories – they are how we make sense of our experiences. Stories define who we are. The same is true with your professional story. Telling the story of your professional transition into software development helps others understand your motives, character, and capacity to reach the goals that you’ve set for yourself. In short, your story makes others believe in you.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> When we say story, this is not something that has been made up or embellished in any way. People can tell when you’re not being truthful. Rather, this is about how to make a true account of a career trajectory engaging and inspiring.</p>

<p>These three questions are the basis of telling your story:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Who are you?</strong> <em>(as a developer, a teammate, a worker, a career changer)</em></li>
  <li><strong>Why are you here?</strong> <em>(Why software development? Why now? Consider both your background but also what drives you to be in this field)</em></li>
  <li><strong>What’s next?</strong> <em>(Where do you see yourself going in this career?)</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Discuss:</strong> What elements make a compelling story?</p>

<p>Examples: something’s at stake, relatable protagonist, overcoming obstacles, turning points, a satisfying ending.</p>

<p>Your story is one of <strong>transition.</strong> These stories are inherently interesting as they have all the elements of a classic story, and most importantly, they have the important elements of change, conflict, and tension around the transition. Where are you going? What will happen next? It’s so exciting for the listener! But it also depends on how you tell that story. Let’s look at some examples…</p>

<h4 id="story-examples-which-story-is-more-compelling">Story Examples: Which story is more compelling?</h4>
<p>During a networking event explored in this <a href="https://hbr.org/2005/01/whats-your-story">Harvard Business Review article</a>, senior managers who’d been downsized took turns telling what they had done before and what they were looking for next. Which of these stories is more interesting for you as a listener?</p>

<p>Story #1: “I started my career as a teacher, and after that, I went to grad school to get my MFA in creative writing. I did some work in publishing during grad school and also worked for an education nonprofit. After that, I moved to Denver and started working at an elementary school as the Director of School Operations. After I left the school, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do next, but I received an email from Joanne at Turing about a new position. I thought it sounded like a great opportunity, so I interviewed and then started working at Turing. After this job, I think I’ll look for something that combines education and coaching since that’s what my job entails now.”</p>

<p>Story #2: “I wasn’t always sure what I wanted to do for a living, but one thing I do know is that I love to help people. This was the driving force behind my decision to join Teach for America after college. I enjoyed teaching because it allowed me to help my students and connect with them on a personal level, but I didn’t enjoy the bureaucracy of working in K-12 education. This became really clear for me when I took a job as an administrator at an elementary school when I first moved to Denver. I had thought that because education had made up the bulk of my career, that this was the logical next step. But I wasn’t happy, and it was clear that I needed a change. I wasn’t sure what that change could be, but I decided to leave my job and take time to figure it out. During this time of self-discovery, I heard about Turing and realized that this could be an opportunity to combine my love for helping others and grow in my own understanding of what that meant. This opened me up to discovering professional coaching and apply that to assisting my students as they transition careers. I feel like I have a much more clear path now that also makes me happy and able to do what I love every day. I want to continue to impact the tech industry in a positive way by helping people from all walks of life utilize their potential and transition to this industry successfully.”</p>

<p><strong>Discuss:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the difference between these two stories? What elements do you see in each story?</li>
  <li>Which character did you care about more? Why?</li>
  <li>Based on these examples, what should your story <em>not</em> be?</li>
</ul>

<p>The second story focuses more on the turning points – the moments that cause your listener to ask, “What happened next?”</p>

<p>Now, let’s apply these ideas to your own story and practice telling it.</p>

<h4 id="you-do">You Do:</h4>

<p><strong>Write:</strong> Reflect on your experience at Turing thus far and write out your story, answering the questions <strong>who are you, why are you here, what’s next?</strong> Think about how others might root for you as a character and what’s at stake for you in your career transition. Consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your Strengths: what makes you the “hero” of this story?
    <ul>
      <li>If you took StrengthsFinder, reflect on how developing your strengths at Turing has influenced your story</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How have you grown at Turing? What obstacles have you overcome?</li>
  <li>What turning points led you to make this career change?</li>
  <li>What does your third act look like? How does transitioning to this career bring some closure to this narrative arc?</li>
  <li>Describe causality – what made you want to make this career change? How is it grounded in your character?</li>
  <li>How you can create trust with the listener</li>
  <li>Creating coherence in your story</li>
  <li>Utilize a story form</li>
  <li>Tell multiple stories – how can you adapt your story to different situations?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pair &amp; Share:</strong> Pair up with someone else and share your story. Your partner should provide feedback on anything that isn’t clear to them or about how you can improve your storytelling skills. What is the most compelling piece of your partner’s story? Remember the principles of providing feedback: specific, actionable, kind.</p>

<p><strong>Debrief:</strong> What stuck with you about your partners’ story?</p>

<h3 id="resumes">Resumes</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve fleshed out your story into an easily told format, let’s focus on the different ways you can convey your story. One of them is through your resume. As a junior developer, your resume might look very different from its previous forms. Here are some things to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reorganize your resume to lead with technical skills and experience</li>
  <li>Analyze what experiences are most useful in demonstrating transferable and applicable skills for an entry level tech role</li>
  <li>Produce a resume with clear and concise language aligned with current tech industry standards</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="research">Research</h4>
<p>Take a look at a few examples before getting started. What do you notice about these resumes?</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h4 id="layouts">Layouts</h4>
<p>You can choose to set up a traditional resume use a template like this <a href="http://visualcv.com/www/google-docs-resume-templates/">traditional resume</a>, but you may want to personalize the style with a layout. Check out these sites for building a resume:</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="content-inclusion---follow-this-order">Content Inclusion - Follow this order</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Header:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Name, phone number, email, GitHub, LinkedIn, personal site (These should all be linked text, not the long URL strings)</li>
      <li>Remove location</li>
      <li>Include title (Software Developer)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Summary:</strong> Summary should be 3-4 sentences about your journey into software developer. Tell the reader:
    <ul>
      <li>Who you are: As a software developer? Team member? Career changer? Individual?</li>
      <li>How you got here: Why software development? Why Turing? Why now?</li>
      <li>What’s Next: What do you hope to accomplish? What are you looking to gain from this experience? Is there a particular industry/tech stack/project you would like to be working with?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Continue to add to this area outlining your technical specialties (languages, frameworks, testing and tools). Ideally you want 12-20 items by the end of the program.
    <ul>
      <li>Highlight your dev/technical skills first. Include any transferable skills in this section as well.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Projects:</strong> Follow skills with a project section that includes 2-3 of your favorite projects. What are you proud of? Show it off! Answer the following questions:
    <ul>
      <li>What does your application do? What problem does it solve?</li>
      <li>Who is it built for? What does it allow the user to do?</li>
      <li>What is the high level overview of the project?</li>
      <li>What technologies did you use? Dive into what API’s, frameworks and languages you incorporated.</li>
      <li>In what period of time was it built? This helps set folks’ expectations appropriately. A product built in two months should look a lot more polished than one built in two weeks.</li>
      <li>If you worked in a group, what was role in the project?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Does each project on your resume link to a GitHub repo? Does the ReadMe for each project include screenshots of the application in action? Include clickable web addresses.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Experience:</strong> Follow Projects with Experience
    <ul>
      <li>Title as “Experience” rather than “Employment”</li>
      <li>Format should start with title followed by company</li>
      <li>Use dates</li>
      <li>Use bullet points (3-5 per organization) &amp; focus on the value that you brought to the organization rather than the individual tasks performed. Answer the questions: <em>What did you accomplish in this position?</em> or <em>What are you most proud of?</em> rather than, <em>What were your boring day-to-day duties?</em></li>
      <li>Turing can fall under experience or education but having it fall under experience brings it closer to the top and ties in with your self identification as a software developer. <em>Titling this category as “experience” rather than work history/employment allows for it to include things aside from paid employment</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Education
    <ul>
      <li>Remove dates. List in reverse chronological order, from the most recent to the least recent</li>
      <li>Remove GPAs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As you update your resume, check on what updates you need to make to your LinkedIn – update this profile as often as necessary to ensure it reflects exactly what you want it to portray.</p>

<h4 id="you-do-1">You Do</h4>
<p>Take 10 minutes to explore some different tools and get your resume draft started.</p>

<h3 id="cover-letters">Cover Letters</h3>
<p>Cover letters are a perfect way to tell your story when you’re applying for a job.</p>

<h4 id="layout">Layout</h4>
<p>Here is a template for how you can lay out a cover letter:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>1st paragraph:</strong> Your journey into tech and how this connects to why you care about the industry of the company you’re contacting</li>
  <li><strong>2nd paragraph:</strong> Your skills that are applicable to the job post. Also, highlight any additional skills that you think the reader should know about</li>
  <li><strong>3rd paragraph:</strong> How you’re going to apply your background and skills to make great experiences for the company’s users/customers</li>
</ul>

<p>Check out these examples to see how professional stories can be told through a cover letter:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Example%20Cover%20Letter.pdf">Tommasina Miller Example</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://thinkcage.com/svn/">Jason Zimdars Example</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>What stood out to you about these examples?</li>
  <li>What story are they telling?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other Key Points for Cover Letters:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t talk about what you’re hoping to get from the company (i.e., mentorship, culture, etc.). The letter should be all about what you’re going to give the company as an employee, not take from their business — mentorship and culture will happen <em>anyway</em>, and not mentioning it will make you stand out</li>
  <li>Interested in a specific company? Consider how to use their tools or libraries in your projects at Turing. When writing your cover letter to them, mention those in the 2nd paragraph of the cover letter. You’ll look like a great candidate if you’re already familiar with the company’s tools/libraries. You should also consider how to interact with the company’s employees through Pull Requests or GitHub issues.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Professional photo</li>
  <li>Description – <em>how can you tell your story here?</em></li>
  <li>1 project – in M4, keep in mind that you’ll need to include 3 projects</li>
</ul>
