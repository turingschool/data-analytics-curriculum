<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Understand and recognize the three triggers of feedback</li>
  <li>Define and understand the 3 different kinds of feedback</li>
  <li>Write out and deliver thoughtful feedback for your project partner</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="deliverable">Deliverable</h3>

<p>You will submit feedback for each of your project partners this module by sending a paragraph of written feedback intended for your partner in a DM to Allison. She will review your feedback and send you any follow-up notes before the feedback is passed on to your partner. Feedback will also be shared with your instructors.</p>

<p>Back End: this review will happen <em>twice</em> in the module.
Front End: this review will happen <em>three times</em> in the module.</p>

<p>Why are we talking about this?</p>

<p>The benefits of giving and receiving feedback well include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Increased learning and improvements</li>
  <li>Other people find it more enjoyable to work with you</li>
  <li>Easier to collaborate with others to solve problems</li>
  <li>You can set an example to help others see the value in seeking feedback for themselves</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Personal Reflection:</strong></p>

<p>Think of a couple of pieces of feedback in the recent past that you found tough to receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What were the most immediate thoughts to go through your mind as you received this feedback?</li>
  <li>How would you describe your experience in relation to the three triggers (truth, relationship, identity)?</li>
  <li>Which of the three triggers do you find most perplexing and why?</li>
  <li>What might help you manage these triggers?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Turn &amp; Talk:</strong> Share your experience with a partner</p>

<p>Recap the 3 triggers as a whole group:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Truth</li>
  <li>Relationship</li>
  <li>Identity</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="three-kinds-of-feedback">Three Kinds of Feedback</h3>
<p>In order to better recognize our triggers, we need to first understand what kind of feedback we’re hearing</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Appreciation</strong> is giving thanks to your partner and encouraging your partner to keep doing what they’re doing well.
    <ul>
      <li>To be effective:
        <ul>
          <li>Specific</li>
          <li>Authentic</li>
          <li>Delivered in a form that works for you</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Coaching</strong> is discussing a better way to do something to help you grow. Coaching can be related to improving your skills or at fixing a perceived imbalance in a relationship.
    <ul>
      <li>To be effective:
        <ul>
          <li>Listening</li>
          <li>Asking questions</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation</strong> is telling your partner where they stand compared to a standard or compared to others. Evaluation aligns expectations and clarifies consequences.
    <ul>
      <li>To be effective:
        <ul>
          <li>Be clear the standards or expectations to evaluate against</li>
          <li>Aligns expectations and informs decision making</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="examples---which-type-of-feedback-is-this">Examples - which type of feedback is this?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“I admire how you jumped into discussing our Git workflow. I was feeling lost about that, and you helped me understand it more because you took the time to explain what you were doing.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“I would have liked to hear your ideas more. It seemed like you were hesitant to share them with me and questioned yourself a lot. I think the initial brainstorming phase would be a good time to share your ideas so that you can test them out or spend time explaining them in a lower stakes environment.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Compared to the last time we paired together, I noticed that you were debugging errors more quickly this time around. I can see that you’ve been spending time going through the docs, and I appreciate how much more efficient that made our worktime.”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tips">Tips:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Ask for the type of feedback you want</li>
  <li>At Turing, you should give and receive appreciation and coaching</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="turn--talk">Turn &amp; Talk</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Which type(s) of feedback will be more difficult for you to give?</li>
  <li>Which type(s) of feedback will be more difficult for you to hear? Are there any triggers that come up?</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s more on why feedback can create triggers…</p>

<h3 id="intention-vs-impact">Intention vs. Impact</h3>
<p>Every dialogue includes <em>intent</em> and <em>impact</em>. The intent (the purpose behind the giver’s message) may not always align with its impact (how the receiver is affected by the message) in conversation. The way we are impacted by feedback can correspond with one of the three triggers.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Feedback</th>
      <th>Giver’s Intent</th>
      <th>Giver’s Impact</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>I think you should work on being more confident</td>
      <td>When you don’t know something, be confident enough to admit it.</td>
      <td>You come across as doubtful or passive; instead, you should give others the impression that you have all the answers. Be a phony.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ul>
  <li>What kind of feedback is this?</li>
  <li>What other impacts might this message have?</li>
  <li>How does this relate to a trigger?</li>
  <li>How could this language be reframed to be more aligned with the intent?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="turn--talk-1">Turn &amp; Talk:</h4>
<p>Discuss these examples with your partner:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Feedback</th>
      <th>Giver’s Intent</th>
      <th>Giver’s Impact</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Don’t be so quick to make a decision without talking to me</td>
      <td>Consider other people’s points of view when making a decision</td>
      <td>I already asked you about everything we did. Do you want me to be passive and not think for myself?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You’re making a lot of strides with TDD. You got a 4 on testing again this project</td>
      <td>Few people ever get a 5, and you got a 4 twice in a row. This is impressive!</td>
      <td>I worked even harder than last project, and I still got a 4. This instructor is too hard on me.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Discussion Questions:</strong>
For each piece of feedback, answer these questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What kind of feedback is this?</li>
  <li>How might you reframe this feedback considering the impact? How does this relate to a trigger?</li>
  <li>We’re thinking about this feedback knowing what the impact is already. How can you be more aware of impact while phrasing your feedback?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="blind-spots">Blind Spots</h3>
<p>Blind spots are always present as a gap between the self we think we present and the self that others see. Even with good intentions, your thoughts and feelings can affect the impact of your communication through behaviors that you don’t always notice. These can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your facial expressions</li>
  <li>Your tone of voice</li>
  <li>Your behavior patterns</li>
</ul>

<p>How could blind spots potentially affect the intent of a feedback giver’s words?</p>

<p>What blind spots should we be aware of when we’re providing written feedback?</p>

<h3 id="being-intentional-in-giving-feedback">Being Intentional in Giving Feedback</h3>
<p>Clarify your intent by following these 3 guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Specific</li>
  <li>Actionable</li>
  <li>Kind</li>
</ul>

<p>What does this look like in action? Generate some norms as a group.</p>

<h3 id="example-of-written-feedback">Example of Written Feedback</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you for your contributions, especially in styling of several of our pages in the last few days. The site presentation looks much better as a result. Thank you also for checking in with me before you began working on a new item. I know that you didn’t always feel strong with some of the more complex aspects of our project, and I think that may have caused you to communicate with me less. I feel like there were several times during the project where either you had a missing DB migration or merge conflicts due to working off a branch with a head far behind our current dev_branch. I would suggest that you communicate with your future pairs more often to help avoid these issues. Committing and submitting PR’s more often, even if it means smaller steps, would also help resolve merge conflicts along the way rather than letting them build into massive problems that take away from project time. In the last two days of the project, I feel like your contributions improved tremendously, and I very much appreciated the work you did.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you notice about this feedback? What’s working well? What would you change?</p>

<h3 id="you-do-work-time-10-mins">You Do: Work Time (10 mins)</h3>
<p>Write out your feedback for your project partner</p>

<p>Keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What should you be aware of?</li>
  <li>How does your tone sound?</li>
  <li>Remember that we’re all trying to help each other – how can you give feedback that will be most meaningful for your partner’s growth?</li>
</ul>
