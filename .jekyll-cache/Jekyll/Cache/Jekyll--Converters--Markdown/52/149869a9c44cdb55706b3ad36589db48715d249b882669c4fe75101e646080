<h3 id="a-note-about-friendships">A note about friendships</h3>

<p>The user story about adding friends states that if User A and User B are in the database and User A adds User B as a friend, then that friendship is confirmed, and User A can now invite User B to a Viewing Party. It does not explicitly state that User B must also add User A as a friend. Think of this like a Twitter “follow” relationship: if I follow you, I can invite you to a Viewing Party, but you can’t invite me to a party unless you follow me first.</p>

<p>As an EXTENSION (once ALL other MVP work is complete):</p>

<ul>
  <li>User A invites User B to be friends, but User B must CONFIRM that friendship request, and now both users can immediately invite one another to Viewing Parties; until User B confirms that friendship, the UI should show User A that User B’s friendship request is still pending, and User B cannot be invited to Viewing Parties yet; User B’s UI should show that there is a friendship request to confirm</li>
  <li>perhaps User B does not want to be friends with User A but does not want User A to know; they should be able to “deny” a friendship request, and User A will forever see that the friendship request is pending but unanswered; User A should have a way to remove the pending request whether User B has denied the friendship or not</li>
</ul>
