<ol>
  <li>Get more practice using the more advanced SQL techniques like joins, grouping, and aggregating</li>
  <li>Use ActiveRecord, SQL, or both to implement queries</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>

<p>Choose one of the following problem sets to work on. You will group up with students who are working on the same problem set.</p>

<p>With your group, work on the problem set. Try to pseudocode the problem first, then check your solution using <code class="highlighter-rouge">rails dbconsole</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">rails c</code>. You will all have the same data sets, so you should be able to reliably check your query on two different development environments and attain the same results.</p>

<h3 id="testing-is-optional-say-what-if-you-do-decide-to-test">Testing is optional. Say What? If you do decide to test‚Ä¶</h3>

<p>Work together to create the feature test and then the queries. Based on how you set up the data/objects in the test, you should be able to reasonably expect a desired result.</p>
