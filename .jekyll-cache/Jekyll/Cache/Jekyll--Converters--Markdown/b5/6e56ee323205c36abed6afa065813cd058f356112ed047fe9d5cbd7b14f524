I"ß<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

<p>Projects require students to apply new concepts from class and build on existing knowledge. Students will have a total of 4 projects in Module 1:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Independent Project</strong> - Begin Monday week 1, due Monday week 2.
    <ul>
      <li>The goal of this project is for students to practice all of the key concepts of module 1 covered in the prework and week 1.</li>
      <li>This project is safe to fail, meaning it will not count towards the final promotion decision at the end of the module.</li>
      <li>Students will be given feedback on their project, but scores will not be recorded.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Paired Project</strong> - Begin Monday week 2, due Thursday week 3.
    <ul>
      <li>This project will count towards the final promotion decision.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Group Project</strong> - Begin Monday week 4, due Thursday week 5.
    <ul>
      <li>This project will count towards the final promotion decision.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Independent Project</strong> - Begin Friday week 5, due Tuesday week 6.
    <ul>
      <li>This project will count towards the final promotion decision.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="independent-challenges">Independent Challenges</h2>

<p>In week 6, students will participate in the Final Independent Assessment that will count towards the promotion decision. This is a 3 hour code challenge students will complete independently, meaning the student cannot seek help from other students, mentors, etc. Students are allowed to reference notes, other projects, and the internet.</p>

<p>In order to practice for the Final Independent Assessment in week 6, students will be given a weekly practice Independent Challenge starting in week 2. They will be submitted using a Github Pull Request, and instructors will give feedback in the form of comments on the Pull Request. These are not formal assessments, but an opportunity for the student to practice their problem solving skills and receive feedback from instructors. Students are expected to complete the first three iterations.</p>

<p>Students can find examples of Independent Challenges <a href="./practice_assessments">here</a></p>

<h2 id="paired-assessments">Paired Assessments</h2>

<p>In week 6, students will participate in the Final Paired Assessment that will count towards the promotion decision. Students will be required to complete a small coding task in advance of the assessment, and then will be given 30 minutes to pair with an instructor on an additional task that builds on their existing code.</p>

<p>In order to practice for the Final Paired Assessment in week 6, students will participate in the Mid Module Paired Assessment in week 4.</p>

<p>Students can reference <a href="https://github.com/turingschool-examples/pets_and_customers">This Example</a> of a paired assessment.</p>

<h2 id="scores">Scores</h2>

<p>Projects, Paired Assessments, and Independent Assessments will be scored on a 4 point scale:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Far Below Expectations</li>
  <li>Below Expectations</li>
  <li>Passing</li>
  <li>Exceptional</li>
</ol>

<p>Projects, Independent Challenges, and Paired Assessments will be broken into 4 iterations. Students are expected to complete the first 3 iterations to receive a score of 3 (passing), while iteration 4 provides opportunities for further learning and exploration.</p>

<h2 id="written-cfu-check-for-understanding">Written CFU (Check for Understanding)</h2>

<p>Students will receive a weekly CFU (check for understanding). This CFU will cover the material up to that week. It is to be completed independently, and is closed note, closed internet. Upon completion, you will receive a copy of the â€˜keyâ€™ or correct/ideal answers - while there will not be a formal part of class set aside to review this content, use this as a resource to guide your studying/work with mentors.</p>

<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-exercises">Ruby Exercises</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Students will use these Ruby Exercises to practice the material covered in Module 1. While the projects require synthesizing many concepts, the Ruby Exercises are meant to practice a concept in isolation. Successful students will reinforce their skills through both projects and exercises. Exercises will not be assigned or graded, however instructors will provide a weekly list of suggested exercises to practice the material.</p>

<h2 id="support">Support</h2>

<p><strong>One-on-Ones</strong>: Students can request to meet with an instructor to talk about non-technical topics at any time. This can include a studentâ€™s progress, stress management, suggestions for improvement, etc. This conversation should not involve laptops, coding, whiteboarding, etc. These will be guaranteed if requested.</p>

<p><strong>Instructor Pairing</strong>: Students can request paired work time with an instructor.</p>

<p><strong>Feedback from Instructors</strong>: Students will receive feedback from instructors for each project, independent timed challenge and paired assessment.  In addition, students will receive a message from the instructors at the end of each week indicating if there are any topics or assignments that did not meet our expectations. If necessary, this message will include suggested actions for improvement.</p>

<p><strong>Mentors</strong>: Upon entering Module 1, students should have been paired with a mentor if for students who opted into the mentorship program. It is highly recommended that students set a weekly time to work with their mentor on <em>technical</em> work.</p>

<p><strong>The Rock &amp; Pebble Program</strong>: Similar to mentorship with an alum, students can opt into a program where they are matched with a Module 2 student.</p>

<h2 id="portfolios">Portfolios</h2>

<p>Students must complete a Portfolio, and participate in a Portfolio Review. Instructions for the Portfolio can be found <a href="./portfolios">here</a></p>

<h2 id="slack">Slack</h2>

<p>Instructors will use the cohort Slack channel as the primary means of communication with students.</p>

<p>When sending a direct message (DM), students must DM ALL instructors. Exceptions are when a DM only applies to one instructor, for instance scheduling a one-on-one.</p>

<h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2>

<p>Attendance is required at 90% or above to pass Module 1. Attendance will be counted at all scheduled activities from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm . Per the Student Course Catalog, tardiness will be counted as absence.</p>
