<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives:</h2>
<ul>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Career%20Unit%20-%20The%20Flower%20Diagram.pdf">Complete the Flower Exercise 1-pager</a></strong> and include a link to either the uploaded PDF or a gist with bullet points for each of the 7 categories.</p>

<h2 id="the-why">The Why</h2>
<p>We do this exercise with students not only because it‚Äôs effective (again, it has an 84% success rate and has been used with job-seekers for the past 4 decades) but because you are transitioning careers to find something that you love ‚Äì not just another job. Learning more deeply about yourself, your values, your strengths, and your priorities will make this a much more fulfilling job search and a much quicker job search.</p>

<h3 id="youre-not-a-role">You‚Äôre Not a Role</h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs start by recapping the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts of professional storytelling. When people have asked you what you do in the past, what have you said? ‚ÄúI was a construction worker.‚Äù ‚ÄúI was a marketing manager.‚Äù ‚ÄúI was a teacher.‚Äù Sound familiar? These kind of declarations lock you into a role; but you‚Äôre not a role, you‚Äôre a person with many skills and many experiences.</p>

<p>Instead, try saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a person who‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>

<ul>
  <li>‚ÄúI‚Äôm a person who‚Ä¶is skilled at building things.‚Äù</li>
  <li>‚ÄúI‚Äôm a person who‚Ä¶has experience in creating stories to attract customers.‚Äù</li>
  <li>‚ÄúI‚Äôm a person who‚Ä¶knows how to explain concepts to others in smaller pieces.‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<p>In this session, you‚Äôll explore who you are from 7 different angles to discover what you want as you start looking for a job. <strong>Because you are not just a software developer now, you are a person who has very specific skills, talents, experience, and goals that make you so much more than <em>just</em> a software developer.</strong></p>

<h3 id="the-seven-petals">The Seven Petals</h3>
<p>I am a person who‚Ä¶has 7 sides to me:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Describe who you are in terms of what you know (favorite knowledges and/or fields of interest)
    <ul>
      <li>Examples: teaching, writing, providing services to others, etc.</li>
    </ul>

          <li>Serve: People from a certain geographical area; people with certain needs, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Describe who you are in terms of your goals or sense of mission and purpose for your life. Or the goals/mission you want the organization to have where you decide to work</li>
</ol>

<p>All 7 aspects are important for your job search; Why?</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a job only matches 1 or 2 ‚Äúpetals,‚Äù it will not be fulfilling to you because it will only allow you to express one or two sides of yourself</li>
  <li>This picture is the most complete of you and defining these aspects will lead you to your dream job</li>
</ul>
