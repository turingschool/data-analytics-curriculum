<h4 id="the-why-why-telling-your-story-is-important">The Why: Why Telling Your Story is Important</h4>
<p>You are a member of the software industry now, and as you start connecting with others in the industry, you need to be able to tell the story of your transition – how did you get here? How do you uniquely make up a part of this industry?</p>

<p>In this session and throughout your career development at Turing, we’ll focus on how you can craft a compelling story to describe who you are, how you came to this industry, and where you see yourself going. This is a story that you’ll tell employers, colleagues at networking events, and even your Turing community. A long, long time from now, when you are ready to graduate, you will give a lightning talk about your experiences at Turing. Today we are going to start that lightning talk by sharing more about what brought you here and what you hope to accomplish. This is the start of you being able to tell your story professionally and find the right match for your future career.</p>

<p>Let’s start by thinking about stories. What do you love about stories? Emma Coats, a former story artist for Pixar, published <a href="http://storyshots.tumblr.com/post/25032057278/22-storybasics-ive-picked-up-in-my-time-at-pixar">this post</a> with her 22 rules for storytelling. We’re going to start with rule #10:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you;
you’ve got to recognize it before you can use it.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Turn &amp; Talk:</strong></p>

<p>What stories stick with you and why? Think of a story that you love; maybe it’s a story from childhood, maybe it’s a book you just finished reading, or maybe it’s a story that has been passed down through your family. Turn to the person next to you and take 2 minutes to retell that story, and then switch.</p>

<p><strong>Quick Debrief:</strong></p>

<p>Sharing from 1-2 people:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What key details do you remember from your partner’s story?</li>
  <li>How did your partner tell the story?</li>
  <li>What made the story interesting?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="individual-reflection">Individual Reflection</h3>
<p>Now it’s time to think about your own story and about yourself as a compelling character. In your journals, reflect on the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What brought you here to Turing and this new career?</li>
  <li>What lenses or identities do you view the world through most often? (Examples of lenses:  gender, ethnicity, family, birthplace, culture, parental status, etc.)</li>
  <li>What are the values that drive you?</li>
  <li>How do you think you demonstrate those values to people around you?</li>
  <li>Could other people identify your values from your actions/words/presence? Why or why not?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="small-group-share">Small Group Share</h3>

<p>Students will get into groups of 4 to discuss key takeaways from their individual reflection. Each group member should get 3 minutes to talk (uninterrupted about the first two reflection questions). Assign someone to keep time. You will have additional time in your group after everyone shares. With that additional time, discuss your ideas for this final question:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How can we operate as a cohort to build on our similarities and learn from our differences?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="whole-group-share">Whole Group Share</h3>

<p>Each groups’s presenter shares their groups discussion of “How do you think these differences/similarities will impact your cohort?”</p>

<h3 id="using-your-strengths-in-your-story">Using Your Strengths in Your Story</h3>
<p>Now think about how you’ve changed and developed since starting at Turing. How has your story changed? How does your development play a part in your story? How can you use your StrengthsFinder themes to tell your story?</p>

<p>Now we’ll frame our stories around how we’re developing at Turing.</p>

<h4 id="individual-reflection-1">Individual Reflection</h4>

<p>Create a gist for <a href="./strengths_storytelling_reflection">your reflection</a> to expand on your story in terms of how you’re progressing and where you see yourself going. Focus on these questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Look at your initial StrengthsFinder reflection that you completed in week 1 – how have your perceptions of the top 5 themes changed?</li>
  <li>How are you different today than when you first started at Turing? Where are you stronger now than on day 1?</li>
  <li>Considering how you describe these themes, how do you want others to see you as you continue to progress through Turing?</li>
  <li>How might these themes play a role in describing your Turing story?</li>
  <li>Even though your Turing story isn’t finished yet, what do you envision for your development in future mods? How will this story end?</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s important to remember that this story is a draft. You’re continuing to grow and learn, and thus your story will change. But this is about starting with our first draft and getting better at refining it as we go through the program.</p>

<h3 id="pair-up-interviewing">Pair Up: Interviewing</h3>
<p>Find a partner to interview. The objective here is to work on telling your story by building in specifics of how you’re developing your strengths at Turing. You’ll have 4 minutes to tell your story, and then your partner will give you 1 minute of feedback on what they heard and ask clarifying questions. Then you’ll switch. We’ll do 2 rounds of interviews to practice our storytelling skills.</p>

<h3 id="whole-group-share-out">Whole Group Share Out</h3>
<p>Share takeaways from your interviewing experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What was easy about this?</li>
  <li>What was difficult?</li>
  <li>What else do you want to keep in mind when it comes to telling your story?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="work-on-lightning-talk-slides">Work on Lightning Talk Slides</h3>
<p>As your prepare for graduation, you’ll be asked to tell the story of your Turing experience in a 5-minute Lightning Talk. Today we will start preparing the slides that you will use for that talk.  In your notebooks, write about how you would design slides and what you would want to be on the slides. Consider how particular images contribute to telling your story.  These are three slides you should focus on at this time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where are you from?</li>
  <li>What brought you to Turing?</li>
  <li>What do you hope to accomplish during your time here?</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of presentation slides:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://slides.com/mattkaufman/deck#/">Matt Kaufman, 1608-FE</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Ali_LightningTalk.pdf">Ali Schlereth, 1608-BE</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/noah_berman_last_day_presentation.pdf">Noah Berman, 1608-BE</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="closing">Closing</h3>

<p>On graduation day, cohorts have the opportunity to share their reflections on their time here.  Over and over again, students comment that they wish they had shared more of their stories sooner, that they wish they had spent more time understanding each other and what experiences brought each person here. Consider ways that you can share your stories, the things that you value, and what you are hoping for in the upcoming weeks. The more connections you can make, the better you will be able to work together towards success.</p>
