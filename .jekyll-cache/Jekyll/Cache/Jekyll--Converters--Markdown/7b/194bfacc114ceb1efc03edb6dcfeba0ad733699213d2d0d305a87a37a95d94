<p>You need a way to crowdsource help for specific topics (they don’t even have to be technical questions!). You also want to know if those answering your questions can be trusted.</p>

<p>You’ll build an application that allows for users to comment and answer on questions posted by other users. They can also vote on the quality of the answers.</p>
