  <li>You should have a copy of

<h2 id="first-12-minutes-individually">First 12 minutes individually:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Briefly read the Hide Delegate section from 181 to 184</li>
  <li><em>Carefully</em> re-read the code sections on 183 and 184</li>
  <li>Reflect on these <strong>key ideas</strong> of Hide Delegate:
    <ul>
      <li>Encapsulation means objects need to know less about other parts of the system</li>
      <li>Rather than talking through, talk to</li>
      <li>You can talk to your friends, but don’t talk to your friends’ friends</li>
      <li>Chains of method calls with different levels of abstraction are a red flag
        <ul>
          <li>Instead, pass the messages like a bucket brigade</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter">Law of Demeter</a> is not a law and is not about agriculture</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Try refactoring <a href="https://github.com/turingschool-examples/refactoring_patterns/blob/master/test/station_3_hide_delegate_test.rb">this</a> example scenario (you should already have this cloned) using Hide Delegate. As you encapsulate the use of the delegated object, make sure the linked test still passes</li>
  <li>If you finish early, apply this refactoring pattern to the Enigma examples found under <code class="highlighter-rouge">Additional Resources</code> in the main lesson for today</li>
  <li>If you still have more time, apply this refactoring pattern to your current project</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-3-minutes-in-your-small-group">Final 3 minutes in your small group:</h2>

<ul>

    <ul>
      <li>What is encapsulation?</li>
      <li>Why would we want to hide delegates?</li>
      <li>What’s one clear indication that you should implement Hide Delegate?</li>
    </ul>
