<p>The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:</p>

<h3 id="1-ruby-syntax--style">1. Ruby Syntax &amp; Style</h3>

<ul>
  <li>4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring. Code is consistently clear and makes excellent use of common ruby patterns and idioms.</li>
  <li>3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization and refactoring but still has some long or difficult-to-read methods. Some ruby idioms or patterns could still be applied more consistently.</li>
  <li>2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring</li>
  <li>1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-breaking-logic-into-components">2. Breaking Logic into Components</h3>

<ul>
  <li>4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility</li>
  <li>3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP</li>
  <li>2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear</li>
  <li>1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-test-driven-development">3. Test-Driven Development</h3>

<ul>
  <li>4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data</li>
  <li>3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality</li>
  <li>2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient</li>
  <li>1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-functional-expectations">4. Functional Expectations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>4: Application completes all required iterations and adds comparable feature(s) of its own design</li>
  <li>3: Application completes all features in Iterations 0-5</li>
  <li>2: Application completes at least iterations 0-3</li>
  <li>1: Application does not complete iterations 0-3</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Echo/Foxtrot Note:</strong> Requirements listed are for <em>Foxtrot</em> pairs – Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration – So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-6</p>
