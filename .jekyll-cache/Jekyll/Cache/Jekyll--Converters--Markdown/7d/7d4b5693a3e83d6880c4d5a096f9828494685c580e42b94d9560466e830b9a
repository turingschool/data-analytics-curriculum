<p>A Static Challenge is practice using HTML and CSS. You are given an image of a webpage and must recreate that page using HTML and CSS.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-time-should-i-spend-doing-the-static-challenge">How much time should I spend doing the Static Challenge?</h2>

<p>You should timebox the Static Challenge to <strong>no more than two hours</strong>. Styling can always be better, so know when to walk away. The goal here is to get some practice using HTML and CSS, not to become masters of styling. As Backend Developers, your time is better spent elsewhere.</p>
