<h2 id="warm-up">Warm Up</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In your notebook, draw a diagram of how the web works.</li>
  <li>Assume the IP address for the website youâ€™re visiting is stored in cache (and therefore no need to draw the entire DNS lookup process).</li>
  <li>Include in this diagram how your server would go about creating the response.</li>
  <li>You can assume your server is built with the MVC design pattern.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-request-response-cycle">The Request Response Cycle</h2>
<p>With a group of 3-4 people, draw out a diagram on a poster of how a client and server interact.</p>

<h4 id="walk-the-room">Walk the Room</h4>
<p>Take a minute to circulate through the room. Mentally compare and contrast the other posters to the diagram made by your own group. What differences do you see? Which details are included that your group forgot?</p>

<h2 id="following-the-bread-crumbs">Following the Bread Crumbs</h2>
<p>Following the user stories listed below, take turns talking through the steps of how the process works starting with the user clicking a button on their browser. Physically utilize the diagram your group created.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>As a user,
When I visit /songs,
Then I see a listing of each song, its title, length, and play count
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>As a user,
When I visit /songs/1,
Then I see the title, length and play count of the song matching that ID
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>As a user,
When I visit /songs/new
Then I see a new song form
And I see input fields for the song
When I click "Create Song"
Then I see the song listed with its details
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>As a user,
When I visit /songs/1/edit
Then I see a new song form
And I see input fields for all attributes
And I see the song's current details in the input fields
And I change any detail about the song
When I click "Update Song"
Then I see the updated details for that song
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>As a user,
When I visit /songs/1
Then I see a "Delete" button
When I click the "Delete" button
Then I see a listing of all current songs and their details
And the song I deleted is not longer present
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Work through each of these user stories with a partner.</p>

<p>Follow the same patterns for <code class="highlighter-rouge">/artists</code>.</p>

<p>Make sure each person talks through a different piece of functionality than before.</p>

<h2 id="group-share">Group Share</h2>
<p>As a group, letâ€™s talk through an example from each piece of CRUD functionality.</p>

<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h2>
<ul>
  <li>How many requests are involved in creating a new record?</li>
  <li>Which part of the process is in charge of packaging up and sending the response?</li>
  <li>Explain in detail what happens when a user visits <code class="highlighter-rouge">www.example.com/songs</code></li>
</ul>
