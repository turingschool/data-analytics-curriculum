I"ø<h2 id="retro-guide">Retro Guide</h2>

<p>During projects, it is important that you meet with your partner or your team to discuss the progress of your project, as well as, at the end of the project reflecting on its completion. These retros provide an opportunity to acknowledge what is working well so you can consciously continue doing what works. It is also important to recognize what is not working or needs improvement, so those issues can be addressed and the whole team can collaborate on a solution.</p>

<p>Below are questions that everyone should address together as a team. Please make a copy of these questions and add them to your feedback gist and include the answers from your retro. Once your group has completed their retro send the link of the gist to your instructors.</p>
