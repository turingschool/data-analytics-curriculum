<h2 id="iteration-3">Iteration 3</h2>

<h3 id="playing-the-game">Playing the Game!</h3>

<p>So far we‚Äôve focused on modeling the data, classes, and methods that make up our game. However we haven‚Äôt done much to put any kind of useable <strong>interface</strong> onto the game. In this iteration, let‚Äôs remedy this by adding a simple Command-Line-Interface (CLI) to the game.</p>

<p>A few key points to keep in mind as you work on this iteration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We‚Äôll abandon testing for this bit ‚Äì the techniques for testing this kind of input/output behavior are somewhat involved and are beyond the scope of this project</li>
  <li>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">puts</code> to display a line of text output to the user</li>
  <li>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">gets</code> to read a line of text input from the user (this will be important to allow users to enter guesses)</li>
  <li>In this iteration we‚Äôll introduce a new file called a ‚Äúrunner‚Äù ‚Äì its job is to serve as the main entry point to our program by starting up a new game</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>First</strong>, create your runner file:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>touch flashcard_runner.rb
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Inside of this file, write the code to do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create some Cards</li>
  <li>Put those card into a Deck</li>
  <li>Create a new Round using the Deck you created</li>
  <li><strong>Start</strong> the round using a new method called <code class="highlighter-rouge">start</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Keep in mind</strong> that your existing objects should already contain, more or less, the data and methods needed to manage this process. Your challenge in this iteration is to build out the input/output messaging to support the user‚Äôs card experience <em>using your existing pieces to store and manage all the necessary data</em>.</p>

<p>When we start the round by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">ruby flashcard_runner.rb</code>, it should produce the following interaction from the command line:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Welcome! You're playing with 4 cards.
-------------------------------------------------
This is card number 1 out of 4.
Question: What is 5 + 5?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then a user will be able to type in a guess, in this case <code class="highlighter-rouge">10</code>, and hit enter to move the game play forward.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>10
Correct!
This is card number 2 out of 4.
Question: What is Rachel's favorite animal?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The game will continue until all the Cards in the Deck have had a guess made against them (until you have completed as many Turns as you have Cards in the Deck).</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>panda
Incorrect.
This is card number 3 out of 4.
Question: What is Mike's middle name?
nobody knows
Correct!
This is card number 4 out of 4.
Question: What cardboard cutout lives at Turing?
Justin Bieber
Correct!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When all the Turns have been made, the game will end and will present the user with a final score.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>****** Game over! ******
You had 3 correct guesses out of 4 for a total score of 75%.
STEM - 100% correct
Turing Staff - 50% correct
Pop Culture - 100% correct
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Seen together, the CLI will look something like this when the game is over:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Welcome! You're playing with 4 cards.
-------------------------------------------------
This is card number 1 out of 4.
Question: What is 5 + 5?
10
Correct!
This is card number 2 out of 4.
Question: What is Rachel's favorite animal?
panda
Incorrect.
This is card number 3 out of 4.
Question: What is Mike's middle name?
nobody knows
Correct!
This is card number 4 out of 4.
Question: What cardboard cutout lives at Turing?
Justin Bieber
Correct!
****** Game over! ******
You had 3 correct guesses out of 4 for a total score of 75%.
STEM - 100% correct
Turing Staff - 50% correct
Pop Culture - 100% correct
</code></pre></div></div>
