<h3 id="part-1---writing">Part 1 - Writing</h3>

<p>First, spend 5 minutes writing an ‚Äúalgorithm‚Äù that explains how to tie your shoes.
Try to be as explicit and specific as possible. Assume your reader is a human, but a
very literal one.</p>

<h3 id="part-2---doing">Part 2 - Doing</h3>

<p>Now, pair up with your neighbor. The person whose name is alphabetically first will
read their algorithm step-by-step to the person whose name is alphabetically last.
The person whose name is alphabetically last will attempt to tie their shoes according
only to the instructions from their partner.</p>

<p>You can repeat instructions if needed, but don‚Äôt add any instructions beyond what
you had originally written down.</p>

<h3 id="an-iterative-process">An Iterative Process</h3>

<p>A generalized process for solving technical problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How will you know when the problem is solved? (Identify the big-picture goal)</li>
  <li>How do you want to use the software? (Indentify the ‚Äúinterface‚Äù)</li>
  <li>What‚Äôs the (next-)most trivial possible case? (Indentify the next small-picture goal)</li>
  <li><em>How</em> do we achieve this goal? (Sketch an algorithm using pseudocode)</li>
  <li>Implement it (do programming)</li>
  <li>Is the whole problem (from step 1) solved? If not, return to 3.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="exercise-1--common-words">Exercise 1 ‚Äì Common Words</h3>

<p>With a pair, answer the questions from steps 1 through 4 for the following problem.
When you get to steps 3 and 4, repeat them at least 3 times for increasing levels of complexity.</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>

<p>I have a text document and want to know ‚ÄúWhat are the three most common words in the text?‚Äù</p>

<p><em>Extension</em>: Let‚Äôs exclude the following: I, you, he, she, it, we, they, they, a, an.</p>

<h3 id="software-processes--techniques--why-do-we-care">Software Processes / Techniques ‚Äì why do we care</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Programming ‚Äì what makes it hard? (Translating ideas into code? Or coming up with ideas?)</li>
  <li><strong>Perception</strong> - A good programmer is someone who solves technical problems <em>easily</em></li>
  <li><strong>Reality</strong> - A good programmer is someone equipped with the tools and processes to confront challenging problems and still emerge successful</li>
  <li>Problem solving challenges: What to do vs. How to do it</li>
  <li>‚ÄúDumping out the toolbox‚Äù - controlling nerves and pacing yourself</li>
  <li>Software development techniques are designed to <em>manage</em> these difficulties</li>
  <li>TDD</li>
  <li>Pseudocode</li>
  <li>Agile Development</li>

<h3 id="odds--evens">Odds &amp; Evens</h3>

<p>I have a file with 100 numbers. I want to create two new files: one with
all the odds and one with all the evens.</p>

<p><em>Extension</em>: Don‚Äôt allow duplicates in the output</p>
