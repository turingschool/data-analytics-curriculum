<h2 id="version-control">Version Control</h2>

<p>A failing project will have few commits, will not use a PR workflow, students with non equal contributions to the codebase, large commits, poor PR messages.</p>

<p>A successful and passing project must have: Students contributed roughly equally to the project in terms of number of commits and lines of code. Commits are made in small chunks of functionality. Students used pull requests as a collaboration tool by reviewing each otherâ€™s PRs, making comments, and never merging their own PRs</p>

<p>An exceptional project will have: Students implement a code review process for their pull request in which each partner makes suggestions for improvements, and those improvements are then integrated into the PR before it is merged. Students integrated HoundCI into git workflow.</p>

<h2 id="functionality">Functionality</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>4</strong> Students complete all iterations.</li>
  <li><strong>3</strong> Students complete iterations 0 through 4.</li>
  <li><strong>2</strong> Students complete all functionality in iterations 0 through 3.</li>
  <li><strong>1</strong> Students do not complete all functionality in iteration 3.</li>
