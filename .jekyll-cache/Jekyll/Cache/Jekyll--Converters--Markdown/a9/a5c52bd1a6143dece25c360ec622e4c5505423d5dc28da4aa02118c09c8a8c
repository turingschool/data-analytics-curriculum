<p><em>This deliverable needs to be submitted to Meg in order to have post-grad job search support from her.</em></p>

<p>The objectives of this plan are to not only help you strategize for your job search after graduation but also to help you plan for your longterm career. After all, your first developer job should align with those goals as well so that you’re on track for a longterm successful career.</p>

<p>Some things to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What do you envision for your career?</li>
  <li>What do you want your 2nd and 3rd jobs to look like?</li>
  <li>How do you want to be involved with the Turing community? The greater developer community?</li>
  <li>Where do your passions lie?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-complete-this-plan">How to complete this plan:</h3>

<p>Create a gist from this template and fill out the first two parts of this plan:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Job Search Plan</li>
  <li>Longterm Career Plan</li>
</ol>

<p>The third part is optional although highly encouraged.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have already secured a job prior to graduation, skip the first part of this plan and please fill out the second part of this plan.</p>

<h2 id="1-job-search-plan-create-a-schedule--goals">#1: Job Search Plan: Create a schedule &amp; goals</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Design a 40-hour “work week” that provides time for:
    <ul>
      <li>Code (ideally, 2-4 hours a day will be dedicated to coding)</li>
      <li>Outreach</li>
      <li>Research</li>
      <li>Network</li>
      <li>Any other areas where you’d like to grow
How much time will you spend on each? When will you do each thing?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Backwards planning: What is your cut-off for ending the job search? When do you want to receive and sign an offer by?</p>
  </li>
  <li>Based on what you outlined above, create monthly, weekly, and daily goals in order to reach your big goal.</li>
</ol>

<p>Keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What skills would you like to improve or develop?</li>
  <li>What is feasible in your schedule?</li>
  <li>What actions will give you the most impact in your search?</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Block out time on your calendar <em>now</em> to adhere to these goals. At the end of each week, assess what worked with the schedule and what didn’t so that you can make adjustments as needed and manage your time even more effectively for the following week.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What “barriers” tend to hold you back in the job search? What steps will you take to overcome those “barriers”?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/kjs222/7ef5e79a71eedf9d8c8d401da1e687c7">Example</a></strong> of clearly outlined goals and schedule to complete them.</p>

<h2 id="2-longterm-career-plan-what-are-your-career-goals">#2: Longterm Career Plan: What are your career goals?</h2>
<p>Where do you want to go in your career?</p>

<p>Reflect on this <a href="http://storyshots.tumblr.com/post/25032057278/22-storybasics-ive-picked-up-in-my-time-at-pixar">narrative rule described by Emma Coats, former Pixar story artist</a>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously.
Endings are hard, get yours working up front.
</code></pre></div></div>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Imagine that it’s 5 years from now - what have you accomplished during that time? How is your life different? What steps did you take to achieve your goals?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a vision statement for these longterm goals.</p>

    <p>Guidelines for writing your vision statement:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Make your statements stretching, challenging, and interrupting of the status quo.</li>
      <li>Write in the future tense (I will…)</li>
      <li>Is the statement grounded – have you been able to demonstrate something similar in the past?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reference what you outlined in your Flower Exercise – what preferred level of responsibility do you want to move to? Do you want to start your own company? What kind of work do you see yourself doing longterm? In your first year on the job, what skills do you want to develop to work towards your longterm goals?</p>
  </li>
</ol>
