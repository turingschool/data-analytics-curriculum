<h3 id="opening">Opening</h3>
<p>In the last cold outreach session in Module Two, our focus was mostly on ‚Äúwarm outreach‚Äù as you used the mentorship network at Turing to start building relationships. But now we‚Äôll take the same principles from that session and apply them to creating relationships with people outside of the Turing community.</p>

<p><strong>Whole Group Discussion:</strong> What are the best practices?</p>

<h3 id="why-cold-outreach">Why Cold Outreach</h3>
<p>When it comes to your job search, meeting people to have discussions about companies and experiences is much more effective than sending your resume out into the abyss. Creating opportunities to meet those people is where cold outreach comes in. The technology industry is a relatively small community, and networking is key to becoming a part of that community.</p>

<p><strong>Whole Group Discussion:</strong> When you‚Äôre reaching out to people, what is your purpose?</p>

<p>Suggested purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Research conversations</li>
  <li>Tour office</li>
  <li>Hiring junior developers</li>
</ul>

<p>Most common purpose: Research Conversations ‚Äì what is the purpose of these conversations? How can you approach this?</p>

<h3 id="how-to-leverage-your-network">How to Leverage Your Network</h3>
<p>How can you leverage the network you already have?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mentors: who does your mentor know who would be helpful to you?</li>
  <li>Use your Trello Board</li>
  <li>LinkedIn: who works at companies that you‚Äôre interested in?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="put-the-cold-in-cold-outreach">Put the COLD in Cold Outreach</h3>

<h3 id="do-some-research">Do Some Research</h3>
<p>What do you know about the person you‚Äôre contacting?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Research their projects on GitHub</li>
  <li>Find individuals on GitHub</li>
  <li>Look for community builders (events, sponsors, etc)</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/#/home/index">CrunchBase</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You need to understand your contact‚Äôs goals as much as you want them to know yours.</p>

<h3 id="finding-contact-info">Finding Contact Info</h3>
<p>Tools:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://emailhunter.co/">Email Hunter</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://findthatlead.com/">Find That Lead</a></li>
  <li>GitHub</li>
  <li>Personal website</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Your Turn:</strong> Spend 10 minutes researching someone from your Trello Board to write an email to today.</p>

<h3 id="crafting-your-email">Crafting your Email</h3>
<p>Develop a template to use. This will help you stay on script and get to the point.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use the subject line:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Short and real - lose the sales pitch</li>
      <li>Relevant and personal</li>
      <li>Consider how the snippet extends the subject line</li>
    </ul>

    <p>‚ÄúLife at [amazing company]‚Äù
 OR
 ‚ÄúWould like to connect‚Äù
 OR
 ‚ÄúQuick Question‚Äù</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Greeting (simple, not overly formal). Make sure to spell their name right:</p>

    <p>Hello [Name],</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Body:</p>

    <p><em>Who am I? How did I find you? What do I want?</em></p>

    <p>I‚Äôm a software developer in Denver about to graduate from the [Name of program] at Turing School of Software &amp; Design. I found your contact info after researching education-focused startups in Denver. I‚Äôm interested in learning more about the work going on at [Company Name] and the Colorado startup scene in general.</p>

    <p><em>What interesting experience do I have that might make me worth meeting?</em></p>

    <p>Before Turing, I taught in Denver Public Schools as a third and fourth grade teacher.</p>

    <p><em>Call to action</em></p>

    <p>Could we grab coffee or get on the phone this week? How does this Wednesday at 4pm sound?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Closing (keep it simple):</p>

    <p>Thanks,</p>

    <p>[Your Name &amp; contact info. Include your personal site if applicable]</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Because you‚Äôve researched your contact, you‚Äôll know if there are certain things you may have in common, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fellow Bootcamp grad ‚Äì mention that you‚Äôd like to learn more about their transition from bootcamp to the tech industry</li>
  <li>Consider timing based on your research ‚Äì have they recently launched a new product? You could tie your message to events or activities that are top of mind to the recipient</li>
  <li>Connections ‚Äì even if you don‚Äôt know someone in common you may have some other connection, like a school or other organization</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-not-to-do">What NOT to do</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use an overly formal tone</li>
  <li>Write a lengthy email (less is more, longer emails won‚Äôt be read)</li>
  <li>Spell their name or company name wrong</li>
  <li>Writing a generic email (make sure to tailor it accordingly)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="practice--group-feedback">Practice &amp; Group Feedback</h3>
<p>Spend ten minutes drafting an email to the person you‚Äôve been researching. Be sure to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Subject line</li>
  <li>Connection</li>
  <li>Call to action with a specific date and time</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pair &amp; Share:</strong>
Form groups of 3-4 (4 max) and spend 15 minutes giving and receiving positive feedback and suggestions for improvement. Person A will read email and person B &amp; C will both give:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 specific piece of appreciative feedback</li>
  <li>1 constructive recommendation for improvement</li>
</ul>

<p>Reminder of guidelines for feedback conversations. Be specific, actionable, and kind! Here are examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‚ÄúI really like the way you circled back to the company mission!‚Äù</li>
  <li>‚ÄúYour subject line does a great job of capturing the reader‚Äôs attention!‚Äù</li>
  <li>‚ÄúThe personal connection about snowboarding was really clear!‚Äù</li>
  <li>‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt quite sure what your connection was. Try out a few different phrases to get more specific.‚Äù</li>
  <li>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hear a call to action. Provide a date and time to meet to make it easy for someone to respond.‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<p>‚ÄúGood job buddy!‚Äù is <em>NOT</em> constructive feedback</p>

<h3 id="follow-up">Follow Up</h3>
<p><strong>What if they don‚Äôt respond?</strong>
If you don‚Äôt receive a response, don‚Äôt assume that means the conversation is dead. During busy weeks, emails can get lost. Send a follow-up email to say that you‚Äôre still interested in meeting and suggest a new date/time. If you don‚Äôt receive a response after that, move on to another contact.</p>

<p>If you receive a response saying they‚Äôre too busy to meet that week or something similar, ask for a better time, and set up a meeting accordingly. Persistence pays off, and you‚Äôre making it clear that meeting them is important to you.</p>

<p><strong>What if they do respond?</strong>
Use the meeting to build a relationship.</p>

<p>Do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ask questions ‚Äì ask about experience, projects, where they‚Äôd work next, what they‚Äôd change about their current role/team, advice for getting started in the industry</li>
  <li>Make eye contact</li>
  <li>Have your story ready to share</li>
  <li>Bring pen + paper, leave computer closed</li>
</ul>

<p>Don‚Äôt:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ask for a job</li>
  <li>Talk about yourself too much</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="closing--next-steps">Closing &amp; Next Steps</h3>
<p>Remember to document your cold outreach in your Trello board ‚Äì this will also make it easier to fill out the deliverable guidelines when you‚Äôve kept a record of what has happened.</p>
