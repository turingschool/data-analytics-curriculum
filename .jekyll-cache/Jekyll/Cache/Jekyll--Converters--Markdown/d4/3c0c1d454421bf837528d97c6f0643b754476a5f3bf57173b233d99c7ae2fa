<p>This Exploration will require that you do a lot more independent (or group) research into the topic than previous explorations.</p>

<p>To get started, find and review some recent blog posts about “rails 5 shopping cart best practices”.</p>

<p>###</p>

<p>Using the main code-along project in Mod 2 (ie, Set List, Bad Tracks, Jukebox, etc), implement tests and code that will satisfy the following user story:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>As an unregistered user,
When I visit the song index
I see a link to “Add to Cart” next to each song.
When I click on “Add to Cart” on the first song
Then the resulting page shows a flash message saying “Added Song to Cart”
And I click a link on the page to "View Cart"
And I see a list of all songs I have added to my cart.
</code></pre></div></div>
