<h2 id="learning-goals">Learning Goals</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Follow an interaction pattern</li>
  <li>Write readable code that adheres to Ruby convention</li>
  <li>Write tests</li>
  <li>Create an Object Oriented Solution to a problem (objects should interact to achieve the stated goal)</li>
  <li>Host code on Github</li>
</ul>

      <td>Application adheres to the flow outlined in the specification and can handle a variety of valid inputs (not just what is outlined in spec). Iteration 3 is complete.</td>
      <td>Only up to Iteration 2 is complete or the application does not follow the flow outlined in the specification.</td>

      <td><strong>Ruby Conventions</strong></td>
      <td>Classes, methods, and variables are well named so that they clearly communicate their purpose. Code is all properly indented and syntax is consistent.</td>

      <td><strong>Testing</strong></td>
      <td>All methods that do not require command line input/output are accurately tested. Best use assertions are made.</td>
      <td>Each class has its own test file. Every method listed on the specification is tested. Most tests are written to accurately verify expected behavior.</td>
      <td>Tests are written for most methods listed on the specification, but the tests may be in an incorrect location or the tests may not accurately verify the expected behavior</td>
      <td>Fewer than 7 tests written (in addition to the card tests provided)</td>
