<h2 id="warm-up">Warm-Up</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Draw a diagram of the table for <code class="highlighter-rouge">books</code> in your Book Club project. What information lives in that table?</li>
  <li>What is the relationship between a <code class="highlighter-rouge">books</code> and a <code class="highlighter-rouge">review</code>? What does this relationship look like on a database level?</li>
  <li>How will this relationship be set-up in the models?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="defining-key-terms">Defining Key Terms</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Primary Key</strong> - a key in a relational database that is unique for each record. This is also known as an <code class="highlighter-rouge">id</code>. It is a unique identifier, such as a driverâ€™s license, or the VIN on a car. You may have one and only one primary key value per table.</li>
  <li><strong>Foreign Key</strong> - a foreign key is a field in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. A foreign key is defined in a second table, but it refers to the primary key in the first table.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="schema--schema-designer">Schema / Schema Designer</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://ondras.zarovi.cz/sql/demo/">Schema Designer</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="one-to-many-relationships">One-to-Many Relationships</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The relationship between <code class="highlighter-rouge">book</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">reviews</code> is a one-to-many relationship.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">reviews</code> has a column called <code class="highlighter-rouge">book_id</code> which refers to the primary key of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">books</code> table.</li>
  <li>Letâ€™s diagram the relationship using a schema designer.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Independent Practice</strong> - Car Dealership</p>

<p>A car dealership has many cars - diagram this relationship using the schema designer.</p>

<h3 id="many-to-many-relationships">Many-to-Many Relationships</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s think about the relationship between books and authors.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  A book can have many authors. An author can have many books.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Independent Practice</strong> - Books &amp; Authors
  Take a minute to consider how our database would need to look in order to support this feature. Add these to your diagram.</p>

<p>Many-to-many is a little harder than one-to-many.</p>

<p>Since books can have multiple authors and an author could have many books, we can implement this relationship by using a <strong>join table</strong>.</p>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Join tables are just ordinary tables with a unique purpose.</em></p>

<p>Letâ€™s diagram the books and authors relationship using the schema designer.</p>

<p><strong>Independent Practice</strong> - Students and Courses</p>

<p>Diagram the many-to-many relationship between students and courses.</p>

<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>

<p>Letâ€™s revisit our learning goals by answering the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is a primary key?</li>
  <li>What is a foreign key?</li>
  <li>What is a schema?</li>
  <li>How does a one-to-many relationship differ from a many-to-many relationship?</li>
  <li>Describe the relationship between a foreign key on one table and a primary key on another table.</li>
</ul>
