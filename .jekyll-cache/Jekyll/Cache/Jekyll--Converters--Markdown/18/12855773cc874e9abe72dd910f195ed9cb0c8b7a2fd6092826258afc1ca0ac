<p><strong>Directions</strong>:
During Module 4, youâ€™ve had a few in-class models and practice sessions for technical interviews. You may have also participated in mock interviews or actual interviews outside of these class sessions. Please write a summary and reflection of 4-6 sentences on your interview participation in a gist that youâ€™ll link in your career development deliverables file.</p>

<p>Suggested ideas to include in your reflection:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What happened in the interview/practice?</li>
  <li>What are some best practices of technical interviews that youâ€™ve discussed?</li>
  <li>What did you excel at in the practice?</li>
  <li>What will you continue to practice as you prep for interviews in the future?</li>
  <li>What surprised you about the practice?</li>
</ul>
