<p>In this session we‚Äôre going to do some hands-on work with basic electronics.
We‚Äôll experiment with a few different types of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate">Logic Gates</a>, which are
some of the fundamental building blocks for modern computers.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-wV10ApCCj-Lsw3fW0WabhedjeGRTkniItBa-My8dns/edit#gid=0">Full Parts List</a></p>

<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>

<p>Each group should have the following materials:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Integrated Circuit (IC) 74LS86 <strong>(2)</strong></li>
  <li>IC 74LS08 <strong>(2)</strong></li>
  <li>IC 74LS32  <strong>(1)</strong></li>
  <li>4-position DIP switch <strong>(2)</strong></li>
  <li>LEDs <strong>(5)</strong></li>
  <li>22-gauge Wire Jumpers <strong>(bunch)</strong></li>
  <li>Power Source <strong>(1)</strong></li>
  <li>USB A to USB A Power Cord <strong>(1)</strong></li>
  <li>Breadboard <strong>(1)</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="intro---breadboard-and-circuit-basics">Intro - Breadboard and Circuit Basics</h2>

<p>Instructor demonstrates basic principles of breadboards including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Connecting power supply to the board</li>
  <li>Connecting Positive and Ground to power rails</li>
  <li>Jumping rails to second sections if needed</li>
  <li>Using resistors and LEDs</li>
</ul>

<p>Students should demonstrate this knowledge by using their board to power on an LED in series with a resistor.</p>

<h2 id="section-1---independent-binary-gate-discovery">Section 1 - Independent Binary Gate Discovery</h2>

<p>Each group should have 3 different types of logic gate integrated circuits as listed above.</p>

<p>These chips each represent one of the primitive logic gates:</p>

<ol>
  <li>OR (Output is on if EITHER input is on)</li>
  <li>AND (Output is on if BOTH inputs are on)</li>
  <li>Exclusive-OR (Output is on if ONE input is on but OFF if BOTH inputs are on)</li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, to help get more ‚Äúbang for buck‚Äù for a given chunk of breadboard space, each chip is printed with <strong>4</strong> of the given gate.
Each gate uses two pins for input and one pin for output, which with 4 gates accounts for 12 of the 14 pins. The remaining 2 are used for
positive voltage (VCC) and ground. All together this makes 14 pins, which will be laid out like below:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> 14 13 12 11 10 09 08
 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
+--------------------+
|                    |
+--------------------+
 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
 01 02 03 04 05 06 07
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For these pins, the layout looks like:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A0 Input</li>
  <li>B0 Input</li>
  <li>Output 0</li>
  <li>A1 Input</li>
  <li>B1 Input</li>
  <li>Output 1</li>
  <li>Ground (-)</li>
  <li>Output 2</li>
  <li>B2 Input</li>
  <li>A2 Input</li>
  <li>Output 3</li>
  <li>B3 Input</li>
  <li>A3 Input</li>
  <li>Positive Input (+)</li>
</ol>

<p>Which when we chart it out gives us:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> +  A3 B3 Y3 A2 B2 Y2
 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
+--------------------+
|                    |
+--------------------+
 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
 A0 B0 Y0 A1 B1 Y1 G(-)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="exercise">Exercise</h3>

<p>Your assignment in this section is to use the provided breadboard and LEDs to complete a <strong>Truth Table</strong> for each
gate. This will allow us to determine which chip is which (AND, OR, XOR).</p>

<p>To do this, you‚Äôll need to connect 2 inputs to one of the gates on each
chip and observe the outputs (an LED works great for an output). Don‚Äôt forget to try the inputs in all of the possible
configurations to determine your outputs.</p>

<h2 id="section-2--medium-challenge--1-bit-full-adder">Section 2 ‚Äì Medium Challenge ‚Äì 1-Bit Full Adder</h2>

<p>A binary adder is a common electronic component that utilizes the gates we‚Äôve seen in the previous exercises.</p>
