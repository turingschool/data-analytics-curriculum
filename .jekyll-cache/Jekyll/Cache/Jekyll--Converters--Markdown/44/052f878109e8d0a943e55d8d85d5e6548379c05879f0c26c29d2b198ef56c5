<p>This project will be evaluated in two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Project Demo</li>
  <li>Asynchronous Instructor Code Review</li>
</ul>

<p>When you are finished, make sure your code is pushed up to your master branch on your repository on Github. Send a link to your repository to all instructors in a Slack direct message.</p>

<h3 id="project-demo">Project Demo</h3>

<p>Each pair will demo their finished game for a small group of your classmates.  During the demo, you will be asked to do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Play your game</li>
  <li>Walk through the code that you implemented to validate ship placement</li>
  <li>Show a diagram and briefly describe your classes and how they interact. This can be a drawing on the board.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your demos should be 10 minutes with an additional 5 minutes for questions from the audience.</p>

<h3 id="asynchronous-code-review">Asynchronous Code Review</h3>

<p>After the project demos, the instructors will provide feedback on your code through the project <a href="./rubric">rubric</a>.</p>
