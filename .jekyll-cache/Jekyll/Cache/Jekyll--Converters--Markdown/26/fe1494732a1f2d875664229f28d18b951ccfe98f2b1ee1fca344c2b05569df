<p>Now that we have some statistics methods done, its time to do some refactoring!  There are a few things to consider when deciding what methods and classes can be refactored and reorganized:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Classes should be compact.</li>
  <li>Classes should have a single responsibility - you should be able to describe what a class is responsible for in one sentence.</li>
  <li>Use the tools we have learned recently when thinking about reorganization - Modules, Inheritance, and Plain Old Ruby Objects (POROs).</li>
  <li>Your code <strong>MUST NOT</strong> break the Law of Demeter.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you refactor, you must maintain the integrity of your existing tests by adding tests for any new methods as you go.  <strong>Every</strong> method should have at least one test!  During this refactor, remember Mocks and Stubs - these can be considered part of a refactor; for example, to better test methods that rely on large datasets, or many helper methods.</p>
