      <td>Students have implemented either inheritance or at least one module in a logical manner.  Students can speak as to how/why inheritance or modules made sense for the given implementation, and why it improves the organization of their code.  No class is over 150 lines long.</td>

      <td>Students have difficulty explaining the reason they have organized their code in the way that they did. They may have few files that seem to be doing the vast majority of the work in the project, and have not drawn clear lines between the responsibilities of different classes they have created.</td>

No methods are longer than 10 lines long. Most enumerables/data structures chosen are the most efficient tool for a given job, and students can speak as to why those enumerables/data structures were chosen.</td>

At least one hash is implemented in a way that makes logical sense.</td>

Few enumerables/data structures chosen are the most efficient tool for a given job. Students may not be able to speak as to why those enumerables/data structures were chosen. No hashes are implemented, or are implemented in an inappropriate use case.</td>

Students are able to speak as to how mocks and/or stubs are fulfilling the above conditions. Spec harness runs in 5 seconds or less.</td>

<p><strong>Required:</strong> Students will document  and implement a code review process throughout the project whereby comments on pull requests are addressed before PRs are merged. Students contributed roughly equally to the project in terms of number of commits and lines of code. Commits are made in small chunks of functionality. Students used pull requests as a collaboration tool by reviewing each otherâ€™s PRs, making comments, and never merging their own PRs.</p>
