<ul>
  <li>Practice creating a Rails application from scratch</li>
  <li>Turning User Stories into tests</li>
  <li>Using tests to drive development</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Try to commit code every 15 minutes at a minimum, push to GitHub often</li>
  <li>When finished, send a private message to all of your instructors with your Git repo</li>
  <li>TDD Throughout. Tests should cover all features and all model-level validations and class/instance methods on your models</li>

<h2 id="gradingrubric">Grading/Rubric</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We‚Äôre mostly concerned that you‚Äôre getting the features finished</li>
  <li>Grading also includes:
    <ul>
      <li>optimal database setup</li>
      <li>good migrations</li>
      <li>strong ActiveRecord relationships</li>
      <li>complete testing at a feature AND model level</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Styling is also not required for this particular exercise.</strong> If you choose to make your code to look nicer, please do so AFTER you finish all other user stories.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Create a new Rails project from your terminal, and implement the following user stories.</p>

<p>Feel free to review any documentation/projects you have at your disposal. (this is ‚Äúopen-book‚Äù)</p>

<h4 id="navigation">Navigation</h4>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>User Story 6 of 11

As a user
When I visit `/students`
And I click on a student's name
I am taken to a show page for that student
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="addresses-one-to-many">Addresses (One-to-Many)</h3>

<p>Let‚Äôs add addresses to this application. In this particular scenario assume that a student can have many addresses (i.e. maybe they have a current address, a permanent address, a parent address, etc.), and that an address belongs to <em>only</em> one student (no students share an address). For today, this will be a one-to-many relationship.</p>

<h4 id="creating-a-new-address">Creating a New Address</h4>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>User Story 8 of 11

As a user
When I visit `/students/:id/addresses/new`
And I fill in description with a description (e.g. "Summer Address")
And I fill in street with a street address
And I fill in city with a city
And I fill in state with a state
And I fill in zip code with a zip code
And I click submit
I am taken to that student's show page
And I see the description, street, city, state, and zip on that page
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="student-has-many-addresses">Student has Many Addresses</h4>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>User Story 9 of 11

As a user
When I visit `/students/:id`
I see all addresses associated with that student (e.g. if that student has two addresses, I see both)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="courses-many-to-many">Courses (Many-to-Many)</h3>

<p>Now we want to check that a student can be enrolled in classes. For this section, don‚Äôt worry about creating a new course. Assume that all courses will be created in the database by an administrator. Also assume that all enrollments (e.g. the particular courses a student will be taking) will be created by an adminstrator. For now, implement the stories below that allow you to view existing relationships.</p>

<h3 id="student-has-many-courses">Student has Many Courses</h3>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>User Story 10 of 11

As a user
When I visit `/students/:id`
I can see a list of courses that student is taking
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="courses-have-many-students">Courses Have Many Students</h3>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>User Story 11 of 11

As a user
When I visit `/courses/:id`
I see the name of that course
And a list of students enrolled in that course
</code></pre></div></div>
