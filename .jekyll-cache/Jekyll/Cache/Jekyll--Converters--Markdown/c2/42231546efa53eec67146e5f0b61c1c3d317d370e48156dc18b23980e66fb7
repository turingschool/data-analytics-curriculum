I"ë<p>On Monday after you leave Turing, youâ€™ll wake up in the morning (or the afternoon) and for maybe the first time in 7 months youâ€™ll find yourself not having a project due, a lesson to attend or intermission work to procrastinate on doing.</p>

<p>The goal of this assignment is to prepare you mentally for the change and to give you some tools to stay on track to be successful in your first year of life as a developer.</p>

<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

<p>At the end of the assignment - you will need to submit your own â€˜Planâ€™ - by creating a gist using this <a href="template.markdown">template</a>. Describe your plan by completing the goals assignment and at least <strong>2</strong> of the other assignments. Include them all in your submission.</p>

<p>If you would prefer your plan not be a public document, create it as a private gist and DM it to your instructor.</p>

<p>After graduation, you should probably throw your laptop in a river and take a day or two off to climb mountains, sit on beaches, play legos with your kids or adult roommates, sleep, etc.</p>

<p>But after that break, youâ€™ll need to fish your laptop out of the river and get back on track.</p>

<p>The pace of development life will â€˜hopefullyâ€™ never be as intense again as it was at Turing - but if you donâ€™t keep learning, your development chops will atrophy.</p>

<h3 id="job-stalking-assignment">Job Stalking Assignment</h3>

<p>Thereâ€™s an old saying - every company in tech is either hiring or in danger of going belly up.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s another old saying - literally every tech company wants a senior developer with 5 years of experience in a framework thatâ€™s 1 year old.</p>

<p>Do <em>not</em> wait to pursue a company just because you havenâ€™t seen them post a â€˜Looking for a Junior Developerâ€™ ad. Youâ€™ll be waiting a long time.</p>

<p>Instead - <a href="assignments/job-hunting.markdown">revisit this assignment that you did earlier in the module</a></p>

<p>If you already profiled companies, how many can you now take off your list? What companies are you more interested in checking out?</p>

<p>Review the data you already collected, collect data for new companies to fill in the blanks on companies you removed from your list. By profiling companies, youâ€™re armed with a lot of different ways to get them to notice you. You may also find that a company you were â€˜mehâ€™ about is actually sounding better and better the more you learn about it.</p>

<h3 id="the-open-source-assignment">The â€˜Open Sourceâ€™ Assignment</h3>

<p>One of the best ways to get noticed, make friends, influence people, make things that help other people and continue learning is contributing to open source projects.</p>

<h3 id="the-community-involvement-assignment">The â€˜Community Involvementâ€™ Assignment</h3>

<p>For a community of people who stereotypically like to work in a dark room, alone, hitting keyboard keys - community involvement sure is a big deal in the world of development.</p>

<p>What weâ€™ve asked you to do in Module 4 is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learn a new language</li>
  <li>Work with ambiguity</li>
  <li>Do all of the above while not burning out after ~5 months of going really hard</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/holman/status/706006896273063936">Zach Holman put it best in this tweet</a></p>

<p>You should be incredibly proud that you are sitting here, reading this lesson right now.</p>

<p>Every single person on staff at Turing is rooting for you to succeed.</p>

<p>(Except for Jorge. Jorge thinks youâ€™re a punk.)</p>

<p>Go forth and continue to make us all proud.</p>
