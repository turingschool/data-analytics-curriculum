I"ª<p>How you schedule, manage, and communicate about your work is more important than the code you write. Let‚Äôs set some clear expectations for ourselves during the module.</p>

<p>Session Plan</p>

<h3 id="schedule">Schedule</h3>

<ul>
  <li>30 Minutes: Project Roles &amp; Responsibilities</li>
  <li>20 Minutes: Writing Stories</li>
  <li>30 Minutes: Pivotal Tracker</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="roles--responsibilities">Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h3>

<p>In a typical project there are several roles including those below. One person might have multiple roles.</p>

<h4 id="product-owner">Product Owner</h4>

<p>The <em>Product Owner</em> is responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Defining the business needs of the project (ie: what should it do, what should it not do)</li>
  <li>Approving the completion of work (ie: deciding whether it does or does not fulfill the expectations based on acceptance criteria)</li>
  <li>Providing the ideas/information needed to write stories</li>
  <li>Setting story priority</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="users">Users</h4>

<p>The <em>Users</em> are responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using the software to achieve their business needs</li>
  <li>Submitting bug reports and feedback</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="technical-lead">Technical Lead</h4>

<p>The <em>Technical Lead</em> is responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Advising the overall technical approach</li>
  <li>Ensuring that code is well built</li>
  <li>Ensuring that strong technical workflow practices are being followed (project tracker, pull requests, documentation, etc)</li>
  <li>Connecting the team with technical resources (mentors, books/articles, etc)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="technical-mentor">Technical Mentor</h4>

<p>The <em>Technical Mentor</em> is responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reviewing code quality and providing feedback</li>
  <li>Helping think through complex technical challenges</li>
  <li>Providing perspective from other experience/projects</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="developers">Developers</h4>

<p>The <em>Developers</em> are responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Turning business requirements from the Product Owner into stories</li>
  <li>Estimating the stories</li>
  <li>Scheduling the stories based on the PO‚Äôs priorities</li>
  <li>Writing acceptance tests that demonstrate the business value described by the story</li>
  <li>Implementing features in fulfillment of the acceptance tests</li>
  <li>Using a strong collaborative method for merging features</li>
  <li>Deploying features into staging for approval from the PO</li>
  <li>Deploying approved features into production</li>
  <li>Gathering feedback from the users</li>
  <li>Turning user feedback into new acceptance criteria, bug stories, etc with guidance from the PO</li>
  <li>Coordinating with the Technical Lead for feedback and planning</li>
  <li>Coordinating with the Technical Mentors for pairing, code review, etc</li>
  <li>Notifying users of new features, changes, etc</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-stories-are-born">How Stories Are Born</h3>

<p>In a perfect world, here‚Äôs how an idea turns into production code:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Product Owner (PO) discusses the business needs with Dev Team (DT), in person or on Slack</li>
  <li>DT drafts and estimates a story or multiple stories, sends to Product Owner for feedback/approval</li>
  <li>PO approves and schedules the story]</li>
</ul>

<p>At that point, the story is ready to be worked on. In a follow up lesson we‚Äôll review the workflow after this point.</p>

<h3 id="writing-stories-20-minutes">Writing Stories (20 Minutes)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Stories communicate intent and achievement</li>
  <li>Good stories are easy to understand</li>
  <li>Like any goals, they should be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">SMART</a></li>
  <li>Serve as the contract between developer and product owner</li>
  <li>But the Product Owner is always right</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-template-for-stories">A Template for Stories</h4>

<pre><code class="language-plain">As a(n) [user type]
In order to [extract business value]
When I [take some action]
  (and [take some other action])
Then I [observe an outcome]
  (and I [observe another outcome])
</code></pre>

<h4 id="quick-story-writing">Quick Story Writing</h4>

<p>Let‚Äôs start with some ideas that translate well to single stories.</p>

<p><em>Imagine</em> we‚Äôve prototyped a small to-do list app. It just allows the user to create to-dos. And it only supports a single user.</p>

<p>Start on your own and draft one story for <em>each</em> of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Users can complete a task and it moves somewhere else.</li>
  <li>User knows how many items are on the to-do list.</li>
  <li>Search my to-do‚Äôs.</li>
  <li>Clicking trash on a to-do pops up a confirm/cancel dialog</li>
  <li>What else does the team need to know to make a successful MVP?</li>
</ul>

<p>Then we‚Äôll turn to a pair and compare our results.</p>

<p>As a group, let‚Äôs brainstorm questions to increase clarity for user stories.</p>

<h3 id="estimating-stories">Estimating Stories</h3>

<p>When we write a story we have to estimate it for the purposes of scheduling. Points-based estimating can be difficult to wrap your head around. Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôll use the points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3 Points - A vague idea or technology we don‚Äôt understand</li>
  <li>2 Points - A concept that we understand, but it‚Äôs too big to start work on (needs to be subdivided)</li>
  <li>1 Point - A story that is understood and ready for work</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="decomposing-stories">Decomposing Stories</h4>

<p>Start with this 2-point story:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>As an unauthenticated user
When I click "Login with Census"
And I login successfully
Then I see only my own todos
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is way too big to start work on! It‚Äôll be in-progress for days.</p>

<p>With your pair, work on drafting at least four 1-point stories that add up to this 2-point story.</p>

<h4 id="big-picture-thinking">Big-Picture Thinking</h4>

<p>Imagine that you get into a meeting with the PO and they tell you <em>‚ÄúOh, by the way, the app should have an API‚Äù</em>. You jot down a quick 3-point story so it doesn‚Äôt get forgotten ‚Äì but there‚Äôs no way to start work on an idea that‚Äôs so vague.</p>

<p>On your own take five minutes to draft at least three 2-point stories about building the todo list‚Äôs API.</p>

<p>Trade a two-point story with your pair and spend five minutes drafting at least three 1-point stories from theirs.</p>
