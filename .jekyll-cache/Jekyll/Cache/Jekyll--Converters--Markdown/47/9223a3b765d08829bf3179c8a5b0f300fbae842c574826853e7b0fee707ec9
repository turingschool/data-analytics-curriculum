<ul>
  <li>Follow an interaction pattern</li>
  <li>Write readable code that adheres to Ruby convention</li>
  <li>Write tests</li>
  <li>Create an Object Oriented Solution to a problem (objects should interact to achieve the stated goal)</li>

      <td>Application adheres to the flow outlined in the specification and can handle a variety of valid inputs (not just what is outlined in spec). Iteration 3 is complete.</td>
      <td>Only up to Iteration 2 is complete or the application does not follow the flow outlined in the specification.</td>

      <td><strong>Ruby Conventions</strong></td>
      <td>Classes, methods, and variables are well named so that they clearly communicate their purpose. Code is all properly indented and syntax is consistent.</td>

      <td><strong>Testing</strong></td>
      <td>All methods that do not require command line input/output are accurately tested. Best use assertions are made.</td>

      <td><strong>Version Control</strong></td>
      <td>At least 30 commits. At least 3 pull requests. Commit messages and Pull Request documentation clearly indicate changes made.</td>

      <td>Code is hosted on Github, but has fewer than 20 commits or has no pull requests</td>
