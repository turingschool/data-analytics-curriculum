<p>Goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understand the various rules governing the behavior of the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code> keyword in javascript</li>
  <li>Understand the precedence of these rules</li>
  <li>Understand the difference between function definition context
and invocation context</li>
</ul>

<p>To cover these topics, weâ€™ll be walking through the issues
covered in this <a href="https://github.com/worace/advanced-js-fundamentals-ck/blob/gh-pages/tutorials/02-functions/03-what-is-this.md">MDN Tutorial on this</a></p>

<p>The main priorities are to cover the various precedence rules
as well as call, apply, and bind. This would take you through
<a href="https://github.com/worace/advanced-js-fundamentals-ck/blob/gh-pages/tutorials/02-functions/03-what-is-this.md#explicitly-setting-context-with-bind">this point</a> in the
tutorial.</p>
