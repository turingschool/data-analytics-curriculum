<h4 id="diagramming">Diagramming:</h4>

<p>For the API consumption portions of your project, draw a diagram of how your classes interact. There are many ways you could go about this. If you Google ‚ÄúClass Diagramming‚Äù, you will probably see very in depth diagrams including ‚ÄúUML (Unified Modeling Language)‚Äù diagrams. You don‚Äôt need to go as in depth as UML. Your goal is to create a diagram of what classes you have and how they interact.</p>

<h4 id="share">Share:</h4>

<p>Share your diagram with a partner. Give them a chance to look through the diagram before you explain it. Don‚Äôt look at code just yet.</p>

<h4 id="discuss">Discuss:</h4>

<p>With your partner:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the diagram clear? How could you make it more clear?</li>
  <li>Look at the code that goes along with the diagram. Do the two match up?</li>
  <li>Is the code readable?</li>
  <li>If something were to change (for example, we switch our current API to a new API), would the code be easy to change? Would it be easy to add on to the code?</li>
  <li>How could you improve your code organization for the API consumption portion of the project? How would this change your diagram?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="presentation">Presentation</h4>

<p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Each student will present on the organization and process for completing one of the consuming the API endpoints user stories. Talk through <strong>why</strong> you made the decisions and less about <em>how</em> the code works.</p>

<p><strong>Reviewer:</strong> As a reviewer you should provide feedback and ask questions.
Things to consider as a reviewer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the code readable?</li>
  <li>If something were to change (such as switching the API) would the code be easy to change?</li>
  <li>Is the organization of the code easy to follow or understand? Could a new developer add on to the code easily?</li>
  <li>Is there any opportunity to improve code organization for the API consumption portion of the project?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="reflection">Reflection</h4>

<p>Once everyone is finished presenting, take a moment and create a gist or document with your take aways from the Peer Code share. Please then share these with your instructors via DM.</p>
