      <td>Introduce the session with the questions on the first slide: “Why is working on our skills for giving and receiving feedback so important? Why have we chosen this as a skill for you to work on in your career development at Turing?” to solicit answers from students on what they think about feedback; After 1-2 answers, you can move on to introducing the objectives and the deliverable</td>
      <td>Students participate as called on</td>

    <tr>
      <td>10 minutes</td>
      <td>Review Intent vs. Impact: ask <em>What do we mean by *intent</em> and <em>impact</em>?* Then tell students to turn to a neighbor to discuss the two questions on the slide</td>
      <td>Whole Group Discussion, followed by Turn &amp; Talk for 5 minutes, then 2-3 groups share out whole group</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5 minutes</td>
      <td>Review Blind Spots. Say: <em>Blind spots are always present as a gap between the self we think we present and the self that others see. Even with good intentions, your thoughts and feelings can affect the impact of your communication through behaviors that you don’t always notice. These can include: your facial expressions, your tone of voice, and your behavior patterns.</em> Ask the whole group the questions on the slide</td>
      <td>Whole Group Discussion</td>

    <tr>
      <td>5 minutes</td>
      <td>Introduce the parts of the Feedback Conversation. Start by reviewing the 3 types of feedback: Appreciation, Coaching, Evaluation; solicit student volunteers to explain each one. Then discuss the parts of the feedback conversation, which are Open, Body, and Close. Read the information off of the slide</td>
      <td>Students provide answers when prompted</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>12 minutes</td>
      <td>Introduce Switchtracking. Say: <em>When you’re receiving feedback in a conversation, it’s easier to fall prey to our triggers because we’re experiencing them right in the moment. We often experience relationship triggers during a feedback conversation because of the way the other person delivers the feedback. A common reaction to this trigger is Switchtracking. Switchtracking occurs when we stop listening to what the person is saying and instead focus on our issues with the person.</em> Read the steps off of the slide. Then read the Tips for Getting Back on Track off of that slide. Then discuss the example on the next slide with the whole group: <em>What two topics are being discussed here? How could you address both of these topics on their own tracks? How could the feedback giver be more intentional with their feedback?</em> Then have students form groups of 3-4 people and discuss the example on the next slide for 5 minutes with 1 minute of sharing out back as a whole group</td>
      <td>Whole Group Discussion, followed by students finding their groups and discussing for 5 minutes, then back to whole group share-out</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3 minutes</td>
      <td>Introduce active listening by saying: <em>An important skill from the body stage of the feedback conversation is <strong>listening.</strong> What does it mean to actively listen? What can make it difficult to really listen to someone?</em> Ask for people to raise their hands: <em>how many of you have had a conversation where you were thinking about what you would say in response to the other person while they were talking instead of fully listening to them?</em> Most likely, many students will raise their hands. <em>That’s why working on active listening skills is so important.</em> Post link to <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3036026/5-ways-to-improve-your-listening-skills">reading</a> in their slack channels if they don’t have access to the markdown.</td>

      <td>Introduce conversation practice. Have the students first write in their journals what key points they need to discuss and how they will do that. Also, as posted on the slide, have them think about how to use their listening skills during the conversation. Then have students move into their project groups to have their feedback discussion. Reflections should be about 5 minutes and conversations should be about 10 minutes</td>
      <td>Students write in their journals and then sit with project groups to deliver feedback to each other.</td>
