<p>This morning we’re going to spend some time getting our portfolios ready for
next week. Spend the next 90 minutes working on your portfolio. Divide your
time as follows:</p>

<h3 id="60-minutes--open-portfolio-workshop">60 minutes – Open Portfolio Workshop</h3>

<p>Spend this time gathering your materials and preparing your portfolio
according to the instructions <a href="https://github.com/turingschool/portfolios">here</a>.</p>

<p>This is a great time to get help from your classmates in sorting out any git
or formatting issues you have. Don’t forget to use Atom’s built-in markdown previewer to check the formatting on
your document!</p>

<p>Aim to have the following at the end of the hour:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A completed first draft of your portfolio document (minus any remaining pieces from the last week)</li>
  <li>Your portfolio committed to git and pushed to <strong>your fork</strong> of the turingschool/portfolios repo</li>
  <li>An <strong>open pull request</strong> from your fork back to the turingschool/portfolios repo. In the subject
of this PR add <strong>WIP</strong> so that we know it isn’t final – next week when you push your final edits
you can remove the <strong>WIP</strong> note to indicate you are finished.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="30-minutes--peer-portfolio-critique">30 minutes – Peer Portfolio Critique</h3>

<p>For the remaining 30 minutes, pair up with a student in your cohort and spend <strong>15 minutes apiece</strong>
reviewing one another’s portfolios. Use the <a href="https://github.com/turingschool/portfolios/blob/master/rubric.markdown">Rubric</a>
as a guide when evaluating each category. Use the notes that you receive from this portfolio
critique to improve and polish your final portfolio for next week!</p>
