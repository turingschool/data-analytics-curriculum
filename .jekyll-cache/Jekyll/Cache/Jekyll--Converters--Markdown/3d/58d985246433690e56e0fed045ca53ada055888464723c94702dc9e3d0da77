<p>You are to build a playable game of Battleship that runs in a REPL interface. The game will allow a single human player to play against a (simplistic) computer player.</p>

<p>Both the Human Player and the Computer have a 4 x 4 board that holds their ships. Each of them has 2 ships: The Cruiser which is 3 cells long and The Submarine which is 2 cells. A board will look like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  1 2 3 4
A S S S .
B . . . .
C . S . .
D . S . .
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each <code class="highlighter-rouge">S</code> represents part of a ship and each <code class="highlighter-rouge">.</code> represents an empty space. In this case, the Cruiser is held in cells A1, A2, and A3, and the Submarine is held in cells C2 and D2.</p>

<p>During the main phase of the game, the computer and the player take turns firing at each otherâ€™s ships. The board shown above might look like this after a couple rounds of firing:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  1 2 3 4
A H S S .
B M . . M
C . X . .
D . X . .
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where <code class="highlighter-rouge">H</code> represents a hit, <code class="highlighter-rouge">M</code> represents a shot that missed, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> represents a sunken ship.</p>

<p>The Game is over when either the User or Computer sinks both enemy ships</p>
