<p>Working by yourself makes most people less likely to spend time organizing yet
you actually need it more. You donâ€™t want to get down deep into a rabbit hole
only to realize the projectâ€™s due tomorrow and youâ€™re building a feature that
isnâ€™t needed.</p>

<p>In this session weâ€™ll work on planning out iterations of your project.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<h3 id="checkpoints">Checkpoints</h3>

<p>First, letâ€™s establish the checkpoint dates for your project. Itâ€™s due on a
Thursday. The Tuesday before that is a good time to target being feature-complete.
Back up to the previous Thursday and Tuesday for two others. Then back to the
Thursday and Tuesday of the first week. Six total checkpoints.</p>

<h3 id="iterations">Iterations</h3>

<p>Then, for each date, plan an iteration that includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Title for this iteration</li>
  <li>A set of need-to-have bullet points</li>
  <li>A set of nice-to-have bullet points</li>
  <li>The Emergency Plan for what gets cut if you canâ€™t deliver on time</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>

<p>Create a README in the root of your project and write out plans for each
of your six iterations.</p>
