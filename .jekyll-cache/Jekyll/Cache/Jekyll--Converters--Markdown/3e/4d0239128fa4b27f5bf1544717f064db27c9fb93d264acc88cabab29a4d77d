Focusing on these specific objectives allows for students to maximize their time effectively for the job search while in their last module at Turing and prepare for the first few weeks post-graduation.</p>

<h4 id="bringing-it-all-together">Bringing It All Together:</h4>
<p>By achieving the objectives listed above, students will be prepared for a successful job search. They will be able to contact and create relationships to build their professional networks and turn meetings into opportunities. Students will be able to describe clear goals for their job search and how they will meet them. They will be able to participate in technical interviews confidently and develop strategies for job offer negotiations.
