<h3 id="workflow-10-minutes">Workflow (10 Minutes)</h3>

<p>In the previous lesson we explored how business requirements turn into work-ready 1-point stories. Today we‚Äôll continue the flow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A member or pair of the Dev Team (Worker) begins work on the story Tracker</li>
  <li>Worker writes acceptance criteria/tests</li>
  <li>Worker implements the feature</li>
  <li>Worker submits a pull request (PR)</li>
  <li>DT and/or Mentor reviews the pull request for technical expectations [</li>
  <li>Worker merges the PR</li>
  <li>Worker deploys the feature to staging</li>
  <li>Worker tests the feature in staging</li>
  <li>Worker notifies the PO that the feature is ready to test</li>
  <li>PO tests and approves the feature</li>
  <li>Worker deploys the feature to production</li>
  <li>Worker notifies users of the new feature</li>
  <li>Worker solicits user feedback on the new feature</li>
  <li>Worker watches for user feedback or bug reports and, if needed, uses them to create new stories</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="communication-10-minutes">Communication (10 Minutes)</h3>

<p><em>Tracker</em> is the core of our communication, home for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Durable communication between the PO and the dev team</li>
  <li>Definitions of what is to be done</li>
  <li>Scheduling of when it will be done</li>
  <li>Tracking of what feature is at what stage of completion</li>
  <li>Particpants: PO, TL, DT</li>
</ul>

<p><em>GitHub</em> is for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Technical communication among the dev team, mentors, and technical lead</li>
  <li>Organization of code</li>
  <li>Technical documentation</li>
  <li>Particpants: TL, DT, Mentors</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Slack</em> is for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Non-durable communication</li>
  <li>Scheduling people, meetings</li>
  <li>Sharing of files, documents, etc</li>
  <li>Particpants: PO, TL, DT, Mentors</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="environments-10-minutes">Environments (10 Minutes)</h3>

<p>We‚Äôll execute code in three main environments:</p>

<h4 id="development">Development</h4>

<p>Where you do your normal work, probably on your own laptop.</p>

<h4 id="staging">Staging</h4>

<p>An environment that mimics Production as closely as possible. It has the same software and OS as production running the same versions. It has data that‚Äôs similar to production (though often ‚Äúsanitized‚Äù for user privacy).</p>

<p>Production-quality code is deployed to Staging for team and PO evaluation.</p>

<h4 id="production">Production</h4>

<p>Approved features are deployed to production where they‚Äôre accessible to live users.</p>

<p>See <a href="/miscellaneous/getting_started_with_tracker">Getting Started with Tracker</a> lesson.</p>

<h3 id="github-workflow">GitHub Workflow</h3>

<p>You‚Äôre probably already familiar with how to use a feature-branch/PR workflow on GitHub, but here‚Äôs a refresher:</p>

<h4 id="establish-a-master">Establish a <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code></h4>

<p>We start with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch, in this case, the branch we inherit from the previous project, that remains stable and <strong>deployable at all times</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="create-feature-branches">Create Feature Branches</h4>

<p>To add a new feature, say, adding a background job for sending email, we would create a new feature branch called <code class="highlighter-rouge">email_background_jobs</code> and begin doing our work there.</p>

<p>You might use one feature branch for each story, but likely you have a thread of a few stories that are tightly related. It makes sense to build these all on the same feature branch.</p>

<h4 id="completing-a-feature">Completing a Feature</h4>

<p>When we think we have completed the feature, we pull in any new updates from the stable master branch into our feature branch and then push that feature branch up to GitHub. Once there, we open a GitHub pull request to pull our new feature into <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code></p>

<h4 id="evaluating-a-feature">Evaluating a Feature</h4>

<p>At this point, the other persons on the team will look at the pull request to review the code and decide if it is ready to be merged into <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>.</p>

<h4 id="deployment-to-staging">Deployment to Staging</h4>

<p>Once merged, the code should be deployed to your staging environment and the PO asked for review/feedback.</p>

<h4 id="deployment-to-production">Deployment to Production</h4>

<p>If the PO approves of the feature then it should be deployed to master and, likely, users notified of the new feature.</p>

<h4 id="references">References</h4>

<p>For a similar but more advanced version of this workflow, see <a href="http://reinh.com/blog/2009/03/02/a-git-workflow-for-agile-teams.html">here</a></p>

<h3 id="practice-with-tracker-15-minutes">Practice with Tracker (15 Minutes)</h3>

<p>Use your current project Tracker to go through this sequence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a new Feature card with a made-up story (in the ‚ÄúDescription‚Äù box) and save it</li>
  <li>Add an estimate</li>
  <li>Add a question for the PO in a comment</li>
  <li>Set yourself as the owner of the story</li>
  <li>Start the card, imagining that you being development</li>
  <li>Role-play by adding comments to the story as you move the card through each state (ie: ‚ÄúCompleted the feature and pushed to GitHub‚Äù then taking the appropriate action)</li>
  <li>Once it‚Äôs all done, delete the card</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, <em>repeat</em> the process with a Bug card.</p>

<p>Finally, <em>repeat</em> the process with a Chore card.</p>

<p>You‚Äôre ready to start working with Tracker!</p>
