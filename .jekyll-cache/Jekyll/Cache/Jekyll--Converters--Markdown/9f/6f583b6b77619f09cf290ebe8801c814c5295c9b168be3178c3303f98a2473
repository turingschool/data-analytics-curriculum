<p>First, weâ€™ll need a new Rails application. Feel free to name it whatever youâ€™d like, but be sure to create the new application with a postgresql database. Our app will have a <code class="highlighter-rouge">users</code> table, and each user must have a name, email and password (all strings)</p>

<p>Use TDD to implement the following user story</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>As a visitor
I visit the users index
Then I see a list of all users in the database
For each user, I see their name and email address.
</code></pre></div></div>
