<p>Project evaluation will be done on a continual basis through check-ins and the final evaluation. Teams will have checkbox items to complete. To achieve a 3 (<em>meets expectations</em>) in each category, all checkboxes for the 4 criteria should be completed.</p>

<p>Typically, scores higher than 3.0 will be for going ‚Äúabove and beyond‚Äù expectations, learning tools and implementing concepts we don‚Äôt teach in class. Each category has specific criteria to help guide the ‚Äúabove and beyond‚Äù goals.</p>

<p>However, we will not reward ‚Äúheroics‚Äù. Staying up late, pulling all-nighters, is not what this project is about. We‚Äôre here to work together as a team, and solo efforts will generally be discouraged by your project managers.</p>

<h3 id="rubric">Rubric</h3>

<p>The rubric consists of 4 categories. To see the checkboxes for each category follow the links below:</p>
