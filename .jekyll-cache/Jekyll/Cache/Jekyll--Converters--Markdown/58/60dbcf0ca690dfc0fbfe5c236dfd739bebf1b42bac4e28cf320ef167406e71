<p>First, clone down the Rails project:</p>

<div class="language-terminal highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">git clone https://github.com/turingschool/job-tracker.git rails_project
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then clone down the Sinatra project:</p>

<div class="language-terminal highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">git clone https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share.git sinatra_project
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now cd into each project, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle</code> on each project, and youâ€™re ready to go. We will only be looking at the code base and not interacting with the app. If you wanted to run the server and interact with the app, you would need to create your database, migrate your migrations, etc.</p>

<h3 id="exercise">Exercise:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Take a look at this stripped down Sinatra app and this stripped down Rails app. How are they different and how are they similar? Identify 5 differences, and for each one describe 1-2 implications. What effect does that difference have for each framework? If you donâ€™t know exactly, draw on your knowledge and experience and make some educated guesses/inferences. Also, practice your research skills to look into the differences.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Consulting blogs and commentary you find online, identify 3 similarities between Rails and Sinatra.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consulting blogs and commentary you find online, identify 3 things that distinguish Rails, advantages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In your Rails project, what does the <code class="highlighter-rouge">routes.rb</code> file inside of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/config</code> directory do? What does this correlate to in our Sinatra app?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We teach Sinatra by adding some structures that Sinatra doesnâ€™t need, but help you make the transition between Sinatra and Rails. What does a stripped down implementation of Sinatra look like, and what are the pieces weâ€™ve added for educational purposes?</p>
