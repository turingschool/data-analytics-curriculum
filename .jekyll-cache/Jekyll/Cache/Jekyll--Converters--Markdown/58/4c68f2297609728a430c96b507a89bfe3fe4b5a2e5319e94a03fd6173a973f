  <li>What do you think about when you design a view?</li>
  <li>What attributes have you used in your html tags so far?</li>

<ul>
  <li>Accessibility</li>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>Accessibility is often overlooked when designing applications. It is an extremely important part of inclusion. A developer must think about accessibility from inception.</p>

<p>While accessibility is sometimes considered “nice to have” for an application, a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/legalnewsline/2017/06/13/first-of-its-kind-trial-goes-plaintiffs-way-winn-dixie-must-update-website-for-the-blind/#4acd5c3f1b38">recent lawsuit</a> could be a harbinger of accessible applications becoming legally mandated. A man with blindness was unable to navigate a grocery store’s website with his screen reader, and the court ruled in his favor. The grocery store has to set aside money to improve the website and cover the man’s court costs.</p>

<p>In order for us to really understand how to build a rich web experience, we need to know how the web looks like and feels like for those with accessibility needs.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Build empathy for people with accessibility needs</li>
  <li>Identify the 3 main accessibility issues</li>
  <li>Build familiarity with accessibility tools</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-need">The Need</h2>

<p>There are 3 billion (and counting) people using the internet.</p>

<p>In America alone, there are 57 million Americans with a disability (2012).</p>

<p>Consider the following statistics from the <a href="http://www.interactiveaccessibility.com/accessibility-statistics">Census Bureau’s survey taken on July 25, 2012</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>19.9 Million (8.2%) have difficulty lifting or grasping. This could, for example impact their use of a mouse or keyboard.</li>
  <li>15.2 Million (6.3%) have a cognitive, mental, or emotional impairment.</li>
  <li>8.1 Million (3.3%) have a vision impairment. These people might rely on a screen magnifier or a screen reader, or might have a form of color blindness.</li>
  <li>7.6 Million (3.1%) have a hearing impairment.  They might rely on transcripts and / or captions for audio and video media.</li>
</ul>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.practicalecommerce.com/articles/1417-Accessibility-How-Many-Disabled-Web-Users-Are-There-">Pew Internet Project Survey conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International</a>, 54% of adults living with a disability go online.</p>

<p>So it’s about time we start creating web applications that will accommodate all people. As people who are soon going to be moving into the development field, you have the ability to be the change needed in our community.</p>

<p>The internet is a free service that should be accessible to everyone regardless of skin color, socio-economic background, and on top of that physical ability.</p>

<p>We all have become developers for the greater good of those around us. We entered this field because we will have the skill set to solve problems most people can’t even begin to understand. One of the easiest and best places to start is to make sure the internet accessible to those who need it.</p>

<p>We need to not view these as edge cases but instead, begin to advocate for their experience. If the internet was meant for everyone then we should make it for everyone.</p>

<p>Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of HTTP/HTML, tweeted in front of 90 million people during the London Olympics ‘this is for everyone’</p>

<p>The computer will always do exactly what you tell it to. Maybe it’s time we start telling them to do the right thing.</p>

<h2 id="identifying-the-3-main-accessibility-issues">Identifying the 3 main accessibility issues.</h2>

<p>Here are 3 accessibility things to look out for on the web:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Visual</li>
  <li>Mobility</li>
  <li>Cognition</li>
</ul>

<p>Making sure we help accommodate these users allows us to really gear and tune our UI for everyone.</p>

<p>Today, we will talk about the first three on the above list.</p>

<h3 id="wai-aria">WAI-ARIA</h3>
<p>WAI-ARIA is a shorthand for (Web Accessibility Initiative – Accessible Rich Internet Applications). WAI-ARIA is a specification written by the W3C, defining a set of additional HTML attributes that can be applied to elements to provide additional semantics and improve accessibility wherever it is lacking. ARIA breaks down into 3 categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Roles</strong>: define the purpose of an element</li>
  <li><strong>Properties</strong>:  help better describe what an element can do</li>
  <li><strong>States</strong>: like properties that are designed to change – normally with the help of Javascript</li>
  <li>An element can only have one ARIA role at a time, but can have as many properties and states as necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>An important point about WAI-ARIA attributes is that they don’t affect anything about the web page, except for the information exposed by the browser’s accessibility APIs (where screenreaders get their information from). WAI-ARIA doesn’t affect webpage structure, the DOM, etc., although the attributes can be useful for selecting elements by CSS.</p>

<h3 id="rules-of-aria-use">Rules of ARIA Use</h3>

<p>There are a few core rules to keep in mind when using ARIA:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you can use native HTML elements and attributes to communicate the proper semantics (like <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;aside&gt;</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;button&gt;</code>, etc.) and behavior then do so. Adding ARIA support where it’s not needed is <strong>redundant code</strong> that isn’t doing anything. For the most part it won’t lead to problems, but it is a waste of time.</li>
  <li>Don’t change native semantics, unless you really have to.</li>
  <li>All interactive controls such as a button, sliding control, or drag-and-drop widget must be usable by the keyboard.</li>
  <li>There are 2 ways to hide information from the accessibility tree, which should be used very sparingly for situations where content is unimportant or meant to be hidden. An example of this would be hiding icons that have been added to display extra decoration or branding. You can do this either with <code class="highlighter-rouge">role=”presentation”</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">aria-hidden=”true”</code>. <strong>You should never use these on an element that is visible and can be focused with the keyboard, such as an input field or a link</strong>.</li>
  <li>Lastly, all interactive elements such as form fields should have a name associated with them. Something like a <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;label&gt;</code> is perfect, and with ARIA, you can even specify that a certain element is labelled by or described by another element.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="semantic-html">Semantic HTML</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Elements such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;button&gt;</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;aside&gt;</code> when read aloud help clarify what part of the html page someone is focused on.</li>
  <li>These elements have default implicit ARIA roles.</li>
  <li>Keep an eye on these so you can avoid writing redundant code.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="more-obscure-semantic-html5-elements">More Obscure Semantic HTML5 Elements</h4>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;q&gt;&lt;/q&gt;</code>: inline quoted text</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;time&gt;&lt;/time&gt;</code>: date or specific time</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;</code>: reference to a cited book, play, etc</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;input type="email"&gt;&lt;/input&gt;</code>: specific type of input field</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;</code>: detailed caption on an image</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;</code>: code snippet</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;aside&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;</code>: chunk of text that isn’t the primary focus of the page</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;article&gt;&lt;/article&gt;</code>: small subsection of content</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;abbr&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt;</code>: abbreviation</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Example: &lt;nav&gt;&lt;/nav&gt; tags have an implicit role="navigation".

<h4 id="alt-attributes-for-images">Alt Attributes for Images!</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Hugely important</li>
  <li>Low hanging fruit, easy to use on images.</li>
  <li>Be verbose.</li>
  <li>Just do it.</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bad: &lt;img src="mountain.jpg" alt="mountain" /&gt;
good: &lt;img src="mountain.jpg" alt="The cascade mountains at sunset in January" /&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="title-attributes-for-links">Title Attributes for Links!</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Low hanging fruit on anchor tags.</li>
  <li>Not necessary for all links, but make sure to use them for your icon anchors – you know, things like your facebook, twitter, etc icons:</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"facebook-icon"</span> <span class="na">title=</span><span class="s">"Facebook"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;a/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="lang-attribute-on-html">Lang attribute on HTML!</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Low hanging fruit for HTML</li>
  <li>As far as non-english speaking screen readers are concerned, when they land on an english-speaking web page without lang attribute, it will be spoken with the screen reader language - making it impossible to understand - unless the screen reader user disables language switching in the screen reader.</li>
  <li>Just do it</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;html</span> <span class="na">lang=</span><span class="s">"en"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="aria-landmark-roles">ARIA Landmark Roles</h3>

<p>One of the easiest ARIA features to implement, and one that provides significant immediate benefits to screen reader users, is landmark roles. To add them, simply add a relevant role attribute to an appropriate container within your HTML. This allows the screen reader to quickly jump to that section of the page. Below, you will find an example of how you might utilize the different landmark roles for your layout:</p>

<p><img src="../misc/images/aria-landmark-roles.png" alt="Landmark Layout" /></p>

<p><strong>Take note:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The banner, main, and contentinfo roles are meant to be used only one time per page</li>
  <li>Take care in using <code class="highlighter-rouge">role="application"</code> - When assistive technologies encounter content that’s marked up with <code class="highlighter-rouge">role=”application”</code> they stop listening for users’ keystrokes and hand off all functionality to the application. This is due to an expectation that the application has its own model for navigating and operating all controls by keyboard. It generally should not be used.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below you will find a code example of defining three landmark roles:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;header</span> <span class="na">role=</span><span class="s">"banner"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/header&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;main</span> <span class="na">role=</span><span class="s">"main"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/main&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;footer</span> <span class="na">role=</span><span class="s">"contentinfo"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/footer&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="experiment-2">Experiment 2</h3>

<p>If you’re wondering what color blindness is here is a definition found online.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Color blindness, also known as color vision deficiency, is the decreased ability to see color or differences in color. The most common cause of color blindness is due to a fault in the development of one or more of the three sets of color sensing cones in the eye.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="mobility">Mobility</h2>

<p>Mobility is an issue where the user typically has difficulty using a mouse or a trackpad. The first and easiest thing we can do as developers is make sure we are making our application completely usable with just a keyboard.</p>

<h2 id="cognition">Cognition</h2>

<p>Cognitive issues is defined by <code class="highlighter-rouge">webaim</code> as this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The concept of cognitive disabilities is extremely broad, and not always well-defined. In loose terms, a person with a cognitive disability has greater difficulty with one or more types of mental tasks than the average person. There are too many types of cognitive disabilities to list here, but we will cover some of the major categories. Most cognitive disabilities have some sort of basis in the biology or physiology of the individual. The connection between a person’s biology and mental processes is most obvious in the case of traumatic brain injury and genetic disorders, but even the more subtle cognitive disabilities often have a basis in the structure or chemistry of the brain.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A person with profound cognitive disabilities will need assistance with nearly every aspect of daily living. Someone with a minor learning disability may be able to function adequately despite the disability, perhaps even to the extent that the disability is never discovered or diagnosed. Admittedly, the wide variance among the mental capabilities of those with cognitive disabilities complicates matters somewhat. In fact, one may reasonably argue that a great deal of web content cannot be made accessible to individuals with profound cognitive disabilities, no matter how hard the developer tries. Some content will always be too complex for certain audiences. This is unavoidable. Nevertheless, there are still some things that designers can do to increase the accessibility of web content to people with less severe cognitive disabilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That being said, this topic is a little more abstract.</p>

</ol>

<h4 id="code-tip">Code Tip</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Focus</li>
</ul>

<p>Never adjust the focus on your application. Without the focus there is literally no way for a user to know where they are in your application.</p>

<p>One thing you want to consider is utilizing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tabindex</code> attribute. What’s great about this is if you set the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tabindex</code> of something to zero it acts like a <code class="highlighter-rouge">stop sign</code> that makes the screen reader and or tab focus move to a specific part of the page.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Radio Buttons</li>
</ul>

<p>One big thing that can affect users is that sometimes forms utilize radio buttons. The issue with the visually impaired is that many times those radio buttons are difficult to click. What we can do to help improve the experience for our friends is to allow the parent object to be clickable too. Often times it’s just a matter of wrapping your radio button in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">label</code> tag. Check out the following <a href="https://codepen.io/paul66/pen/jKBzu">Codepen</a>. Don’t mind the JavaScript - look at the CSS and the HTML</p>

<p>These are some easy changes we can implement for your application to be more accommodating.</p>

<h3 id="dealing-with-cognitive-issues">Dealing with Cognitive Issues</h3>

<p>Organizing your data in a way that is decreeable and engaging for the user will help combat this. Some things we can do to help draw attention to our document:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using proper headings, and lists</li>
  <li>Using more white space in your design</li>
  <li>“Chunking” content into more manageable pieces</li>
  <li>Making forms manageable by breaking them into multiple, sequential steps</li>
  <li>Providing a logical reading order</li>
  <li>Being consistent with fonts, colors, and locations of page elements</li>
  <li>Offering keyboard access</li>
  <li>Consider offering content in multiple formats</li>
