<p>Today we are going to do things a little different. We are going to self-select ourselves into 2 possible groups. The you should evaluate how you feel about git so far.</p>

<p>Roughly how you should evaluate which group you should be in:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I can use git locally. But I’m not feeling great about.</li>
  <li>I’m making PRs reviewing code and feeling good about git.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="group-1">Group 1</h2>

<p>This group will go through <a href="./git_workflows">this</a> lesson and will have supplemental help from an instructor. The instructor will not be leading you or guiding you through this, but they will be there to get you past a blocker.</p>

<h2 id="group-2">Group 2</h2>

<p>Finally this group will be largely self / pair guided but will go through some more intermediate and advanced git topics. You may reach out to an instructor to ask for clarification, questions or guidance in how to find your answers.</p>

<p>You will be going through <a href="./git_workflows">this lesson</a></p>
