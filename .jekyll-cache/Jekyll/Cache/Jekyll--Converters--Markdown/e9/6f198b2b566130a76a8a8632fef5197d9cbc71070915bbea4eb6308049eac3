<p>Academic success in BEM1 means that students demonstrate proficiency and comfort with the concepts below. The expected mastery level can be understood with the following scale:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mastery</strong>: student is able to explain and implement the concept independently or with light reference</li>
  <li><strong>Functional</strong>: student recognizes when to use the concept and can implement it with the support of documentation and/or a collaborator</li>
  <li><strong>Familiarity</strong>: student can recognize and describe the concept when needed/appropriate, but is not able to implement the technology/technique</li>
</ul>

<p>A student who graduates from this module will be able to do the following.</p>
