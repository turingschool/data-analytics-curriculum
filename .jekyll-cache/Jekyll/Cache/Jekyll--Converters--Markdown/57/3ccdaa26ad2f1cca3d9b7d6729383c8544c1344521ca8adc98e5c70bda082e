<p>The intent of this session is to continue building strong connections in the cohort and share different aspects of our lives that others may not be aware of with a goal toward building a strong and safe culture.</p>

<p><strong>Word of Caution:</strong> Some might feel compelled to share personal information if their partner discloses something personal. Please donâ€™t share anything you arenâ€™t comfortable sharing. Letâ€™s also be careful not to turn this exercise into a competition.</p>
