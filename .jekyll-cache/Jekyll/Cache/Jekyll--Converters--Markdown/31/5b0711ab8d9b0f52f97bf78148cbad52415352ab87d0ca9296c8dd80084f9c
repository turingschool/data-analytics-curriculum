<p>Yesterday, we introduced some concepts, and built some React</p>

<ul>
  <li>What were the new concepts we covered?</li>
  <li>How would you define them?</li>
  <li>What is still fuzzy about React</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quantified-self-in-react">Quantified Self in React</h2>

<p>Let‚Äôs return to our week 1 project, <a href="../projects/quantified-self/quantified-self">Quantified Self</a>.</p>

<p>Instead of using <code class="highlighter-rouge">localstorage</code>, I‚Äôve built an API to store our data. You can access it at: <a href="https://quantified-api.herokuapp.com/">https://quantified-api.herokuapp.com/</a>. I‚Äôll draw the schema on the board so you can more easily work with the API</p>

<h3 id="user-stories-to-components">User Stories to Components</h3>

<p>Let‚Äôs say we wanted to build the foods table for our Manage Foods page. Let‚Äôs not worry about creating the foods yet, just displaying the foods. Here‚Äôs the relevant user story:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I should see a table of all my foods, with Name, Calories and a delete icon for each food</li>
</ul>

<p>Together, let‚Äôs break this down into components, props and state on the whiteboard</p>

<h3 id="split-up-options-time">Split up options time!</h3>

<p>Here‚Äôs your options for the next step:</p>

<h4 id="we-do">We do</h4>

<p>Let‚Äôs break down these user stories into components, and then build those components, together.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each meal table has a list of foods by name and calorie</li>
  <li>Each meal table has Total Calories below, which is the sum of calories for each food in that meal</li>
  <li>Each meal table has Remaining Calories, which is the goal calories minus the total calories. Goal calories are as follows: 200 for Snacks, 400 for Breakfast, 600 for Lunch and 800 for Dinner</li>
  <li>When I visit index.html (or just <code class="highlighter-rouge">/</code>), I see tables for each meal for today</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="you-do">You do</h4>

<p>Actually build the components for the foods table that we just broke down. When that‚Äôs finished, see if you can add the following stories to your application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When I click ‚ÄúAdd Food‚Äù, and all fields are filled, the food will appear at the top of the table below</li>
  <li>When I click the ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù icon next to a food, it will be removed from the list.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="back-together">Back together</h3>

<p>Let‚Äôs all come back together and review each other‚Äôs solutions.</p>

<h3 id="split-again">Split again</h3>

<p>For the next section, we‚Äôre all going to have the same task, but varying levels of collaboration and instruction. You aren‚Äôt locked into the option you choose in the beginning. If you‚Äôd like to move to a different group at any time, go for it.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre going to create our ‚ÄúAdd to‚Äù buttons for each of the meal tables. Here‚Äôs the user stories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When I click one of the meal buttons under the Add Selected To header, I should see any checked foods appear in the meal table for the clicked meal on the date currently being viewed.</li>
  <li>After adding a food to a meal, I should see any relevant Calorie totals update.</li>
  <li>After adding a food to a meal, I should see the checkboxes in the Foods table clear.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the original project, you had separate tables to manage foods, and to add foods to the meal tables. For this lesson, it‚Äôs fine to combine them into one component on the same page.</p>

<h4 id="guided-work">Guided work</h4>

<p>I‚Äôll be with you right from the beginning. I‚Äôll guide you through most of the steps, and maybe even do some coding along. I may have to step away periodically to work with this second option</p>

<h4 id="head-start">Head Start</h4>

<p>You‚Äôll be on your own at first, but I‚Äôll come by to check on you periodically to make sure you aren‚Äôt stuck.</p>

<h4 id="i-got-this">I got this</h4>

<p>You don‚Äôt need my help, you need to get coding. I encourage you to work in pairs, and to work through the whole user stories &gt; whiteboard &gt; components &gt; code process.</p>

<h3 id="reflection-and-next-steps">Reflection and next steps</h3>

<p>With our remaining 15 minutes, let‚Äôs talk about what we‚Äôve covered, and possible next steps for your relationship with React</p>

<p>Same questions as yesterday. Define the following React terms in your own words:</p>

<ul>
  <li>JSX</li>
  <li>Component</li>
  <li>Prop</li>
  <li>State</li>
</ul>

<p>And reflect on a few things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How is React different from the front-end development you‚Äôve done?</li>
  <li>What surprised you about React?</li>
  <li>What do you still need to learn to be an effective developer of React applications?</li>
</ul>

<p>And also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are your next steps with React, in your capstone project and after Turing?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you‚Äôd like to learn more about using React in Rails, <a href="https://github.com/applegrain/creact">Lovisa‚Äôs Creact tutorial</a> has been a trusted Turing resource for a while now.</p>
