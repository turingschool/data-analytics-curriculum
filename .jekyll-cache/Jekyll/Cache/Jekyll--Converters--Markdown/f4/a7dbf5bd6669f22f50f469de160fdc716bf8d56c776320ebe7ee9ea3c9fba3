<p>— Atwood’s Law</p>

<hr />

<p>In this project, we’ll be designing an interpretation of a traditional desktop application using Electron and React. The choice of which application is up to your group, but must be approved by Steve on Monday morning by 9:30am. Keep in mind that you’ll have roughly four days to complete this.</p>

<p>Here are some helpful suggestions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A clone of the OS X Notes application</li>
  <li>An application converting Markdown-to-HTML</li>
  <li>An application for storing and keeping track of recipes</li>
  <li>An application for keeping track of reminders (and reminding you of them)</li>
  <li>A simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winamp">WinAmp</a> clone (alternatively, it could keep tract of a list of Soundcloud files)</li>
  <li>A color picker and manager like <a href="http://giantcomet.com/hues/">Hues</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A simple application done really well is better than a complicated application done poorly.</p>

<h3 id="a-word-of-caution">A Word of Caution</h3>

<p>Not only is this a brand new project, but we’re going to do something that hasn’t really been done too many times in the past. We’ll be wading through plenty of uncharted waters and have to figure out a lot of the solutions on our own. The hope is that you’ll have the foundation of something worth talking about at the end of the project, but the main goal is to learn a ton.</p>

<h3 id="pre-work">Pre-Work</h3>

<p>You’ll be expected to have reviewed the following materials by Monday.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbSvc8_BHaw">Building Desktop Applications with Node and Electron</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://vimeo.com/155240396">Getting Started with Electron</a></li>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>Since this is <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/terra%20incognita">terra incognita</a>, a big part of the project will be documenting our travels. One of the goals of this project is strengthen your portfolio and there is no better way to do that than to showcase your expertise in an area that not may other people know about. In addition to programming, you’ll be writing a blog post. The post will consist of a few components:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An introduction to what both Ember and Electron are and how they work at a high level</li>
  <li>Some of the philosophies behind Ember and Electron and why you do or do not believe a good choice for this project</li>
  <li>A particular technical problem that you encounter and how you solved it (or your efforts to solve it, if you didn’t end up solving it)</li>
  <li>A post-mortem on what went well and what you would improve upon if you were to continue working on this project or if you started over</li>
</ol>

<p>Each section is worth 15 points for a total of 60 points.</p>

<p><strong>Important Note</strong>: It’s easy to complain how stuff is hard in a blog post. Not only is that not particularly helpful to anyone who reads your post, it turns out that most open source software is created by humans and humans have a tendency to feel really bad when you complain about their donated efforts.</p>
