<p>The specifications give you some classes to help you start breaking this problem down, but you will also have to create some additional classes and methods to build an Object Oriented solution to this problem. This means that there should be very little code outside of a class and you are using your classes to create objects that interact in some way.</p>

<p>Additionally, this project will require you to use Test Driven Development for all methods that do not <strong>rely</strong> on user input.  <em>very few</em> methods should rely on user input.</p>

<p>You and your partner are expected to commit frequently and use Pull Requests. Make sure you are doing this frequently throughout the project.</p>
