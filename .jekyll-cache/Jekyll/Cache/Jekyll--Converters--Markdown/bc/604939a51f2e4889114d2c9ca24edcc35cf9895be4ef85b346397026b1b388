<ul>
  <li>Be able to define the term pseudocode and algorithm</li>
  <li>Be able to use pseudocode to describe the flow of an algorithm‚Äôs implementation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="part-1---writing">Part 1 - Writing</h3>

<p>First, spend 5 minutes writing an ‚Äúalgorithm‚Äù that explains how to tie your shoes.
Try to be as explicit and specific as possible. Assume your reader is a human, but a
very literal one.</p>

<h3 id="part-2---doing">Part 2 - Doing</h3>

<p>Now, pair up with your neighbor. The person whose name is alphabetically first will
read their algorithm step-by-step to the person whose name is alphabetically last.
The person whose name is alphabetically last will attempt to tie their shoes according
only to the instructions from their partner.</p>

<p>You can repeat instructions if needed, but don‚Äôt add any instructions beyond what
you had originally written down.</p>

<h2 id="big-picture">Big-Picture</h2>

<h3 id="what-is-an-algorithm">What is an algorithm?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A programming algorithm is a computer procedure that is a lot like a recipe (called a procedure) and tells your computer precisely what steps to take to solve a problem or reach a goal. The ingredients are called inputs, while the results are called the outputs.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-pseudocode">What is pseudocode?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pseudocode is an informal high-level description of the operating principle of a computer program or other algorithm.</li>
  <li>Programming ‚Äì what makes it hard? (Translating ideas into code? Or coming up with ideas?)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="an-iterative-process">An Iterative Process</h3>

<p>A generalized process for solving technical problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How will you know when the problem is solved? (Identify the big-picture goal)</li>
  <li>How do you want to use the software? (Identify the ‚Äúinterface‚Äù)</li>
  <li>What‚Äôs the (next-)most trivial possible case? (Identify the next small-picture goal)</li>
  <li><em>How</em> do we achieve this goal? (Sketch an algorithm using pseudocode)</li>
  <li>Implement it (do programming)</li>
  <li>Is the whole problem (from step 1) solved? If not, return to 3.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="additional-exercises">Additional Exercises</h3>
<p>Answer the questions from steps 1 through 4 for the following problem.
When you get to steps 3 and 4, repeat them at least 3 times for increasing levels of complexity.</p>

<h4 id="common-words">Common Words</h4>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>

<p>I have a text document and want to know ‚ÄúWhat are the three most common words in the text?‚Äù</p>

<p><em>Extension</em>: Let‚Äôs exclude the following: I, you, he, she, it, we, they, they, a, an.</p>

<h4 id="odds--evens">Odds &amp; Evens</h4>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>

<p>I have a file with 100 numbers. I want to create two new files: one with
all the odds and one with all the evens.</p>

<p><em>Extension</em>: Don‚Äôt allow duplicates in the output</p>

<h3 id="lats--longs">Lats &amp; Longs</h3>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>

<p>I have a file with 100 latitude/longitude pairs. Find the point that‚Äôs closest to the north pole.</p>

<p><em>Extension</em>: Find the one closest to the <strong>magnetic</strong> north pole.</p>
