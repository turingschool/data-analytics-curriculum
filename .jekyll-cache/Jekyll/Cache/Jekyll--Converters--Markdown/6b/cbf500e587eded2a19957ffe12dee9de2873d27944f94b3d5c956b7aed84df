<p>Breaks during a module are a great opportunity to review topics covered up to this point, explore a new topic, or prep for the upcoming weeks. Over the break there is <em>not</em> an expectation for you turn in any work. You know what is going to be most beneficial for you and how best to spend your time.</p>

<p>It is encouraged that you do some form of practice over the break, so that you when you come back it will not feel as difficult to get back in the groove. Below are some outlined suggestions. It is not recommended or necessary that you complete all of them.</p>

<h3 id="problem-solving">Problem Solving</h3>

<p>These are some resources for challenges. Do time-box the amount of time you spend on a problem. It is recommended that you treat these as you might an interview challenge.
Think about what is your process‚Äù
Where do you start?
What do you do when you‚Äôre not sure what comes next? What questions do you ask/google?
Even if you don‚Äôt finish a challenge, focus on what went well and what might be holding you back?</p>

<p>Ruby or JavaScript</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="javascript-focus">JavaScript Focus</h3>

<p>If you would like some more focus on JavaScript here are some ideas to help.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Go back over the first project and either refactor code or start from scratch to re-create it.</li>
  <li>Videos to watch:

<p>In a few weeks you will have your cross pollination project. If you are thinking about using a new language, not Rails or JavaScript, now is an opportunity to look into that language a little bit, so you have an idea of what you are getting yourself into. You can always visit one of the links in the problem solving section to see if they have the language you are interested in.</p>

<p>You may also try <a href="https://github.com/ts25504/awesome-koans">Programming Koans</a> A programming Koan looks like a test where you will ‚Äòfill in the blank‚Äô with the right answer. It may help you get a look at the languages syntax and how the language behaves without having to build a new project for yourself.</p>

<p>#Conclusion</p>

<p>These are all different paths of opportunity and are suggestions for how you might spend a little of your time over break. Please <strong>do</strong> spend time over the break in the way you need to and don‚Äôt stress out about the above. These are only suggestions and the completion or non-completion <strong>does not</strong> affect your promotion. Have a happy holiday!</p>
