<h3 id="opening">Opening</h3>
<p>Why is working on our skills for giving and receiving feedback so important? Why have we chosen this as a skill for you to work on in your career development at Turing?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whole group discussion</li>
  <li>Discuss objectives and deliverable</li>
</ul>

<p>Last module, we focused on giving written feedback. Today, we‚Äôll discuss techniques for providing feedback in a face-to-face conversation.</p>

<h3 id="review-intent-vs-impact">Review: Intent vs. Impact</h3>
<p>Whole Group Review:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What do we mean by <em>intent</em> and <em>impact</em>?
  The intent (the purpose behind the giver‚Äôs message) may not always align with its impact (how the receiver is affected by the message) in conversation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Turn &amp; Talk:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How might intent and impact function differently in a verbal conversation vs. written feedback?</li>
  <li>What are some norms you might want to set when having an in-person feedback conversation in order to more fully align your intent with your impact?</li>
</ul>

<p>2-3 groups share out.</p>

<h3 id="review-blind-spots">Review: Blind Spots</h3>
<p>Blind spots are always present as a gap between the self we think we present and the self that others see. Even with good intentions, your thoughts and feelings can affect the impact of your communication through behaviors that you don‚Äôt always notice. These can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your facial expressions</li>
  <li>Your tone of voice</li>
  <li>Your behavior patterns</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="whole-group-discussion">Whole Group Discussion:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>What might blind spots look like in conversation? Looking for examples.</li>
  <li>How does a certain blind spot affect the impact of the message?</li>
  <li>How can you be more aware of your blind spots?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="communicating-feedback-in-conversation">Communicating Feedback in Conversation</h3>
<p>Ask for the type of feedback you want - and prime yourself for triggers that could arise in response to it. Reminder - the 3 types of feedback are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Appreciation</li>
  <li>Coaching</li>
  <li>Evaluation</li>
</ul>

<p>How to conduct a feedback conversation:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Open</strong> the conversation by getting aligned
    <ul>
      <li>Define the purpose of the conversation</li>
      <li>What kind of feedback are we discussing?</li>
      <li>What does the giver want to give me?</li>
      <li>Is the feedback negotiable or final? A suggestion or a command?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Body:</strong> Two-way exchange of information
    <ul>
      <li>Listening</li>
      <li>Asserting</li>
      <li>Managing conversation process</li>
      <li>Problem-solving</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Close</strong> by committing to action</li>
</ul>

<p>Whole Group Debrief:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What will make this conversation different with a project team vs. having this conversation with just one partner?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="switchtracking">Switchtracking</h3>
<p>When you‚Äôre receiving feedback in a conversation, it‚Äôs easier to fall prey to our triggers because we‚Äôre experiencing them right in the moment. We often experience relationship triggers during a feedback conversation because of the way the other person delivers the feedback. A common reaction to this trigger is Switchtracking. Switchtracking occurs when we stop listening to what the person is saying and instead focus on our issues with the person. Here‚Äôs what it looks like:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Steps</th>
      <th>Result</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Step 1</td>
      <td>You get feedback</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Step 2</td>
      <td>You experience a relationship trigger and may question the person‚Äôs skills/judgment, credibility, or intentions</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Step 3</td>
      <td>You change the topic to how you feel</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Step 4</td>
      <td>You talk past (or think past) the other person who continues to stay on the original topic.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Suddenly, neither of you are on the same page, and the feedback isn‚Äôt getting heard.</p>

<h4 id="tips-for-getting-back-on-track">Tips for Getting Back on Track</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Spot the two topics, the original one and the relationship one. You must increase your awareness of what‚Äôs happening.</li>
  <li>Separate the who from the what. Discuss each separately on its own track</li>
  <li>Help the feedback giver be clear about their meaning</li>
  <li>Explore the dynamic in the relationship and identify what each of you is doing that contributes to the problem</li>
  <li>When you get coaching feedback, watch for possible relationship issues that might lurk below the surface</li>
</ul>

<p>Discuss example with whole group:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Feedback Giver</th>
      <th>Feedback Receiver</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>I‚Äôd like to see you ask for my input more.</td>
      <td>You don‚Äôt trust me to complete this on my own?</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ul>
  <li>What two topics are being discussed here?</li>
  <li>How could you address both of these topics on their own tracks?</li>
  <li>How could the feedback giver be more intentional with their feedback?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="small-group-discussions">Small Group Discussions</h4>
<p>In groups of 3-4, discuss how to address this switchtracking conversation. Start by identifying what the two topics are, and how they might be addressed. Discuss how this feedback conversation might look in the opening, body, and close in order to align intent with impact as closely as possible.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Feedback Giver</th>
      <th>Feedback Receiver</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Please make sure to follow the system we set up with Waffle cards. There were a few times where you started working on a Waffle card but not indicating that you were working on it by moving it to the ‚ÄúIn Progress‚Äù column, and work got duplicated.</td>
      <td>I told you what I was doing when we were sitting next to each other. You don‚Äôt seem to be listening to me.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4 id="active-listening-reading">Active Listening: Reading</h4>
<p>An important skill from the body stage of the feedback conversation is <strong>listening.</strong> What does it mean to actively listen? What can make it difficult to really listen to someone?</p>

<p>Read through these <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3036026/5-ways-to-improve-your-listening-skills">5 steps for improving listening skills</a></p>

<h3 id="putting-it-into-practice-having-the-conversations">Putting it into Practice: Having the Conversations</h3>
<p>Now is the time to prepare for giving feedback to your project partners in conversations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>BE: Bike Share (multiple partners)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Reflect:</strong> Write down any key points, think about how you can clearly explain your intent, and take into consideration what kind of feedback you need from the other
  Also, consider how you will incorporate active listening into this conversation ‚Äì what do you need to do to ensure that you‚Äôre able to practice those 5 steps from the article?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Have the conversation:</strong> Follow the Open-Body-Close format for this conversation. Ask clarifying questions.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Plan for follow-up:</strong> This is one conversation on how the project is going so far and how you want to finish it, but consider any feedback that will need to be discussed after the project is over</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="final-reflection--next-steps">Final Reflection &amp; Next Steps</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Complete a personal reflection:
    <ul>
      <li>What is your biggest challenge when giving feedback to someone else? What will you need to be aware of to overcome that challenge?</li>
      <li>In a year from now, if you‚Äôre practicing these conversations regularly, how will your communication skills have changed?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As your project wraps, make sure to have any continued or follow-up conversations with your project partners, including a full retro.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Reflect in your deliverable using the <a href="./feedback_conversation_reflection_guidelines">template</a> on at least 1 feedback conversation <em>(but you should be having conversations each time you work with someone else)</em></li>
</ul>
