<p>We’ve done a lot of things so far in JavaScript - and we’ve done a whole lot of things in Ruby… but what have we done in both languages?</p>

<p>Trying the same challenge out, first in JavaScript and then in Ruby is an incredibly good learning experience.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Submit a link to your repo of the JavaScript implementation:</li>
  <li>Submit a link to a ruby implementation:</li>
</ol>

<p>Notes: Neither project needs to be deployed - and the ruby version absolutely doesn’t need to be pretty. The goal is simply to compare the two language’s ways of getting the same problem done.</p>

<p>Talk about your experiences coding the two implementations below:</p>
