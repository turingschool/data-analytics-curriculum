<h2 id="solid-design-principles">SOLID Design Principles</h2>

<p>SOLID is an acronym for 5 design principles that help software developers write better code. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Single responsibility principle</li>
  <li>Open/closed principle</li>
  <li>Liskov substitution principle</li>
  <li>Interface segregation principle</li>
  <li>Dependency inversion principle</li>
</ul>

<p>In module 1, we will focus on the first of those principles.</p>

<h3 id="single-responsibility-principle">Single Responsibility Principle</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">Single Responsibility Principle Wikipedia Page</a></p>

<p>The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that every class and method should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software. Put more simply, each class and method should do one thing.</p>

<p>So far, we have seen classes and methods as tools we can use to organize our code into logical chunks. When we write those classes and methods, we want to ensure that they follow SRP. There are two main reasons we would want to do this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>To make our code readable</li>
  <li>To make our code maintainable</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="dry">DRY</h3>

<p>DRY stands for Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself. Just like SRP, DRY makes our code both more readable and maintainable. Reasons we would do this:</p>
