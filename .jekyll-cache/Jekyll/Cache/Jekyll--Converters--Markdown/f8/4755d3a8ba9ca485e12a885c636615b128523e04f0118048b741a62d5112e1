<p>Module Three is the module in which the personal development of the previous two modules is applied to job searching and discovering the right path for studentsâ€™ new careers. Introducing technical interview prep, how to research professional opportunities in tech, and how to build on professional branding are focuses in this curriculum because students now have the confidence to tackle these pieces successfully in preparation for a robust job search in Module Four.</p>

<h4 id="bringing-it-all-together">Bringing It All Together:</h4>
<p>Students will leave Module Three with a clear blueprint for their job search by first identifying what it is that they want out of their job search, practicing how to tell that story clearly, and reflecting on how their strengths apply to finding this new, fulfilling career path. Students will be able to apply these ideas practically through utilizing strategies to find opportunities that match their goals and creating straightforward plans to reach those goals. Finally, students will be able to both describe how to and demonstrate being an active citizen in the tech community.</p>
