I"<p>Whether youâ€™re going right into a job, still job hunting, or repeating module 4 - you should work to identify goals for how you want to continue growing technically as a developer.</p>

<p>This could be something like â€˜learn GoLangâ€™, â€˜contribute to open sourceâ€™, â€˜improve my JavaScript abilitiesâ€™, â€˜build a weird thingâ€™</p>

<p>At the end of module 3, you became a â€˜real developerâ€™ - so when you think about how to achieve these goals you should be thinking of them like a developer would. For example, if you walk in to an interview and say you know Go, that means youâ€™ve built something in Go, not that youâ€™ve taken a codeschool AND codacademy course in Go and followed along with a TODO app tutorial.</p>

<p>Focus on real ways you can demonstrate your learning and motivate yourself to keep at it.</p>

<p>To get started, here are 2 goals you will want to schedule for the next 6 weeks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h4 id="informational-interviews">Informational Interviews</h4>

    <p>Now that youâ€™re â€˜on your ownâ€™, youâ€™ll want to start networking in a low-stress, low pressure sorta way. Informational interviews are a good way to do this. We covered this stuff in our PD sessions. You are required to get 3 informational interviews by the end of your first 7 weeks off.</p>

    <p>If it were me I would assign myself due dates like:</p>

    <p>End of week 2 - one informational interview
   End of week 3 - two additional informational interviews
   End of week 4 - three additional informational interviews</p>

    <p>That way you can have a little leeway should you not get an interview one week. These interviews should not be terribly hard to get since they are only informational.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="blog-post">Blog Post</h4>

    <p>Keep fresh on things and keep your voice active in the community. This blogpost will be either the open-source contribution post, or a technical post (whichever you did not do for the portfolio in mod4).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="next-identify-personal-goals">Next, Identify Personal Goals:</h3>

<p>List three individual learning goals that you would like to accomplish over the next year.</p>

<h3 id="define">Define</h3>

<p>For each goal:</p>
<ul>
  <li>State where you are currently at with this goal
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. â€˜I have given a lightning talk on Goâ€™, â€˜I downloaded EMACSâ€™, â€˜I am at an intermediate level with JavaScriptâ€™</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Define what success looks like after 1 year</li>
  <li>Outline resources for learning
    <ul>
