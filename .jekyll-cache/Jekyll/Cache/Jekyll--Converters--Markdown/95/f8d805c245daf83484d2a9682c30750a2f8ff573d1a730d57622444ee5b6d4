<h2 id="how-to-ask-for-what-you-want">How to Ask for What You Want</h2>

<p>For some reason we live in a world that is afraid to talk openly about money. That changes for you today. In this session, we’ll have an open discussion about averages our alums are currently making in full-time junior developer jobs, apprenticeships, internships, and contract/freelance opportunities – and how you should negotiate for what you want.</p>

<p>Reflect in journals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you hear the words “bargaining” and “haggling,” what words or images come to mind?</li>
  <li>When you hear the word “negotiating,” what words or images come to mind?</li>
  <li>How are these images/word associations different or similar?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Turn &amp; Talk:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>How would you answer the question, <em>“what are your salary expectations?”</em></li>
</ul>

<p>When you are asked that question, recognize that you don’t have the context to provide an answer – and you don’t have to.</p>

<h3 id="discussion-points">Discussion Points</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Why Negotiating Matters:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A negotiation conversation could take as little as 5 minutes. Think about that. You generally can’t do 5 minutes of work this year and have your boss give you an extra $10,000. But you can pick up $10,000 in salary negotiations just by having a conversation about your compensation. That makes your negotiation five very important minutes so that no money is left on the table. You can’t afford to <em>not</em> negotiate.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Keep in mind that the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-0323-pay-gap-20160323-story.html">wage gap</a> in <a href="http://www.payscale.com/data-packages/gender-pay-gap/women-in-tech">tech</a> is very real. Creating transparency around salaries is an important step in closing that gap, and that transparency starts with negotiations. Do not let money stay on the table that could be yours.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Shift your Mindset to Embrace Negotiations:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Turn &amp; Talk:</strong> What did you write down at the beginning of the session about your associations with the idea of negotiating? It’s time to unpack our feelings about negotiating in order to be empowered to have this conversation in a meaningful way. What are your initial feelings about the idea of negotiating?</li>
      <li>Bottom line: Successful people negotiate</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Back to the initial question – “What are your salary expectations?”</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>If asked, <em>“What are your salary expectations”</em>, do not put a number on the table – you can’t offer and negotiate for yourself. Instead, say: <em>“I would love to hear what you’re offering for this position so I can have more context for the conversation.”</em></li>
      <li>During this discussion, you may be talking with a hiring manager. Don’t be offended if they ask you again – they are just doing what they’ve been told, and they might not be equipped to go through a negotiation at that time. You should still push back about wanting to know more about what is being offered.</li>
      <li>Never give a number. If you’re filling out an online form, and it expects an answer, it’s fine to write in 0 or $1 and mention that you want to have an in-person discussion (as all salary discussions should be).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>After Receiving an Offer:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> You receive the following offer:
        <ul>
          <li>$70k with benefits</li>
          <li>Unlimited PTO</li>
          <li>$2500/yr for professional development</li>
          <li>$75/month for transit</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>How would you handle an offer like this?</p>

    <p>#### You Do
Spend some time thinking about this example offer, and write in your journal some things that you want to consider if this was offered to you.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Take at least 24 hours: When you receive an offer, do not accept on the spot. You don’t even have to negotiate on the spot. Say, <em>“Thank you so much for this opportunity! I need to take some time to review the offer (you can say with your partner, mentor, etc. if you don’t feel comfortable leaving it open ended). Could you send me the offer in writing so I can review it?”</em>
        <ul>
          <li>You want to sound excited and interested, but you’re also biding your time, so you can you consider any other offers and think this through</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Consider all pieces of the offer and weigh the pros and cons; is there more value in negotiating another part of the offer than salary?
        <ul>
          <li>What do <em>you</em> care about?</li>
          <li>What’s missing from the offer? What didn’t they talk about?
            <ul>
              <li>In this example, they did not mention a 401k, maternity/paternity leave, signing bonuses, or other perks</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Talk to someone you trust to get some feedback (mentors, Lia, Meg, etc.)</li>
      <li>Reach out to any other companies that you’re talking with. Let them know that you’ve received an offer, and ask, <em>“do you know what your timeline is for making a hiring decision?”</em> Ask for any next steps.
        <ul>
          <li>Why do this? You’re leveraging your offer (see <em>Create Leverage</em> below). You’ve also taken the guessing game out of it; instead of stressing about the offers, the ball is in their court.</li>
          <li>This also tells the company that you a person who is sought after, which increase their interest</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>You may not always have the luxury of a lot of time. What if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Someone says, <em>“I need to know an answer in 48 hours.”</em> You should still get as much information as you can, but you might not be able to</li>
      <li>In this case, create a pro and con list – to decide which offer you’ll take</li>
      <li>It’s not a red flag that they need you to hurry necessarily – maybe they just got a bigger workload</li>
      <li>Think about it as a whole – what were your interactions like? What are the relationships with the team members?</li>
      <li>You can still talk to your other companies – <em>“I found out I need to let them know by this time, is there a way I could know about your hiring deadline by then? I’m still really interested.”</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Negotiating an Offer:</strong> Once you have all the facts and can make a decision, go back to the company –
    <ul>
      <li>Always negotiate in person or via phone, <strong>never through email.</strong></li>
      <li>Eliminate passive language when negotiating, but always be generous and respectful.</li>
      <li>Be honest and transparent</li>
      <li>Get all of the facts – are there other potential opportunities not on the table yet? What are your priorities that you need to discuss?
        <ul>
          <li>For instance, in this example, consider asking for other benefits – “Unlimited PTO” sometimes means no PTO. Ask “what’s your minimum PTO days? Do you require people to take a certain amount of time off? How frequently do people take off?” This work-life balance questioning will help you understand the culture</li>
          <li>Maternity/paternity – even if you don’t currently have kids or unsure if you want kids, you need to know what the plan is for maternity and paternity leave. It’s much harder to negotiate later. This is the same with healthcare and 401k match</li>
          <li>Don’t forget about mentorship – you can get that written into your contract</li>
          <li><strong>Never trade salary for equity</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The general rule of thumb is to ask for 5-10% more than what was offered. Never ask for more than 10% more than what they offered you, unless there are rare circumstance that you’ve discussed with someone you trust prior to negotiating.</li>
      <li>“I’m excited about this offer. I was hoping to make <strong>X</strong>. How can we close the gap on this?”
        <ul>
          <li>Using “we” shows that this is a joint effort</li>
          <li>Not an aggressive move – “close the gap” instead of “I need this”</li>
          <li>Don’t mention another company or their offer – that becomes aggressive. Tech industry is small, and companies talk. Don’t give them a bad impression; plus, you don’t know what’s happening behind the scenes</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="pair-practice">Pair Practice</h4>
    <p>Partner up with someone and role play having a conversation around negotiations with each other. One partner will play the hiring manager while the other partner practices negotiating. Then switch. Please approach this practice with good intentions – <em>we’re not trying to make this harder than it already is.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>What if a Company Can’t Meet Your Counter?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If the company is unable to meet your counter offer, <em>this is okay.</em> It is good practice to always negotiate</li>
      <li>Consider asking for a three-month review to set goals and milestones and continue to evaluate what you’re worth</li>
      <li>Follow that up with a six-month review to evaluate your performance against those goals/milestones
        <ul>
          <li>Say something like, <em>“I want to see these goals, and if I make them by 6 months, I want to then discuss a raise in my salary.”</em> Bring it up in initial negotiation to put it on the table, and even if they do reviews later in the year, it doesn’t hurt to ask during the initial negotiation.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Another way to ask is for a signing bonus:
        <ul>
          <li><em>“I know we can’t meet my salary requirements, but what about rounding it out with a signing bonus?”</em></li>
          <li>Companies are more likely to try this since it’s a 1-time thing</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You could also negotiate moving costs, but be aware that this is a reimbursement, not something you can take</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Keep in Mind:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Don’t negotiate too high, so you don’t waste that extra money you could’ve negotiated earlier</li>
      <li>Negotiating just an extra $1000 or two isn’t worth it – it doesn’t even out to a lot of money. It could make you look petty. You don’t want to ruin a relationship over it</li>
      <li>There’s always a (small) chance that someone can rescind an offer, but it’s very unlikely – it’s costly to the company to take that back.
        <ul>
          <li>In the 500-600 people that Lia has had experience with coaching negotiations, that has only happened once.</li>
          <li>If a company rescinds simply because you brought up the conversation while you were respectful, that was probably a red flag and you dodged a bullet</li>
          <li>You should be somewhere you want to be and where you’re valued</li>
          <li>If they rescind the offer because you were disrespectful, that’s different. <em>But we don’t expect you to be disrespectful</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Create Leverage:</strong> When you’ve been meeting with other companies
    <ul>
      <li>If you are in other interviews, let those companies know you’ve received an offer letter, but that you’re most interested in an opportunity with their company. Then ask if they could let you know a timeline for making a hiring decision so you can let the other company know when you could make your decision by. (Always do this verbally – never through email.)</li>
      <li>When you find out timelines from the other companies you’re interviewing with, let the offering company know that you’re very thankful and excited for the opportunity; however, you’re deep in the process with “x number” of companies, and it’s too early into your career to burn any bridges; you’d like to honor the process. Could you give them an answer by “X” date? (Always do this in person or via phone so the hiring manager can hear you’re sincere).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Bottom Line: Negotiating is Always Important</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>…even if it’s just to ask clarifying questions!</li>
      <li><strong>It’s important for you to advocate for yourself because there’s no guarantee that anyone else will</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="faqs">FAQs</h3>

<h4 id="does-the-first-number-set-up-subsequent-numbers">Does the first number set up subsequent numbers?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Yes – say they offer $80k, which is a great offer, but think longterm. In 2-5 years with a potential 1-5% increase, will that be enough? Take into account inflation rates and cost of living. What’s great now might not be great in 2 years. This is why developers change jobs as often as they do.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="is-it-better-to-be-at-the-high-end-of-salary-in-your-first-job-of-your-career-and-max-out-or-meet-in-the-middle">Is it better to be at the high end of salary in your first job of your career and max out? Or meet in the middle?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Go for what you can get. Since you probably won’t stay at your first job for 2 years, don’t think so much about strategy – if you tap out, you’ll go somewhere else</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-if-you-ask-for-context-and-the-company-says-heres-what-well-pay-how-do-you-feel-about-it">What if you ask for context, and the company says, “here’s what we’ll pay, how do you feel about it?”</h4>
<ul>
  <li>You could say, <em>“I’d love to learn about the position and everything that this position would entail to have this conversation at a deeper level.”</em></li>
  <li>You could also say, <em>“My expectations were closer to X.”</em> But don’t price yourself out of the conversation. Be honest in that situation – if it’s not a realm that you’re comfortable with, be aware that it is fine to end the conversation.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="when-theres-an-unexpected-answer-what-do-you-do">When there’s an unexpected answer, what do you do?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If the answer is in the lower end, you could say something like, <em>“I was hoping to be closer to $75k, is there any wiggle room there?”</em> This will help them understand flexibility.</li>
  <li>If the number is on the high end, absolutely don’t put a number on the table! Keep a straight face and thank them for that information. You still want to ask questions about the benefit packages and perks. Learn from this awesome story:
    <ul>
      <li>Someone who made no more than $30k previously was asked for expectations during a job interview for his first dev job. He didn’t say anything yet, but he was hoping for $65k. The hiring manager said, “We start juniors at $97k.” If the dev had put his first number on the table, he could’ve lost out on $30k.</li>
      <li><em>This is why you never put a number on the table</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-can-you-approach-negotiating-for-work-visas">How can you approach negotiating for work visas?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Find a US-based company with international ties. You could talk to them about being relocated to another country. They will do a sponsorship, but it’s easier for them because US taxes are still being paid. Any companies with locations in other countries are already willing to have that conversation</li>
  <li>Otherwise, we would recommend to not ask for a visa during negotiations because that’s an indication that you’ll be leaving them</li>
  <li>For a company with international ties, you could say you don’t have a visa right now, and do they sponsor visas? For big companies, it’s more likely as visas can cost up to $10,000</li>
  <li>You could consider taking a lesser salary to negotiate visa sponsorship</li>
</ul>
