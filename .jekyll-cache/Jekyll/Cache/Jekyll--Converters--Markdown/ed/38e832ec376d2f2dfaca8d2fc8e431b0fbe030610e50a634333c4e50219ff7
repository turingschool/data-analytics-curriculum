<p>Have you ever had an issue in your production environment or pulled down code only to realize it was broken. When you ask the person that pushed it up about the issue, they respond:</p>

<p><img src="./assets/it_works.png" alt="It works on my machine" /></p>

<p>Docker aims to avoid these types of interactions by creating an isolated and sharable environment for code to execute in.</p>

<p>First let‚Äôs talk about some of the benefits to this approach:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Packaging Environments</li>
  <li>Distribution of Environments</li>
  <li>Runtime</li>
  <li>Scaling</li>
</ol>

<p>How does docker create these isolated sharable environments? Docker uses what they call <strong>containers</strong> to do this. A container is simply an empty execution environment and might be referred to as a sandbox. The container is ‚Äúfilled‚Äù when there is an <strong>image</strong> to run. It could be said that a container is an instance of an image.</p>

<p>So, what is an image? Great question! An image is a snapshot of the config environment that has been built from the rules with in the Dockerfile.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs walk through Dockerizing an application together.</p>
