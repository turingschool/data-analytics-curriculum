<h3 id="-overview"><a name="overview"></a> Overview</h3>

<p>This project is built in two 2-week sprints over the course of 4 weeks. The first sprint is “greenfield”, meaning you are starting from scratch. The second sprint is “brownfield”, meaning you will inherit an existing codebase. In this case, from another group from a previous cohort.</p>

<h4 id="faq">FAQ</h4>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why are you doing this to me?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Most grads go on to work with existing codebases. Navigating pre-exisitng code is a necessary skill that will require you to perfect your process and be more thorough. You’ll also learn how the decisions you make impact others which will hopefully lead you to be a more considerate developer. Tests, git commits/messages, and code quality all take on new meaning.</p>

<h4 id="project-proposal">Project Proposal</h4>

<p>Each group must have their project proposal approved prior to starting work. Use the template below to pitch your idea.</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gu">### [Project Title]</span>

<span class="gu">### Pitch</span>

1 sentence that explains the value proposition of the application. How would you explain it to a potential business partner, team member, or investor?

<span class="gu">### Problem</span>

1-3 sentences describing the problem that you are trying to solve.

<span class="gu">### Solution</span>

1-3 sentences describing how your application will solve that problem.

<span class="gu">### Target Audience</span>

1-3 sentences describing what type of user your app would be applicable to.

<span class="gu">### Integrations</span>
<span class="p">
*</span> Which APIs will you use?
<span class="p">*</span> Which OAuth integration are you planning to use?
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="-sprint-1"><a name="sprint-1"></a> Sprint 1</h3>

<p>In sprint 1, you’ll be building a new platform from scratch to handle multiple types of users (guests, registered users, admins etc). You’ll build a new project which must be approved by the instructors. This is sometimes called “greenfield” development, because you are starting from scratch.</p>

<p>During this project, you will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a secure web application that supports multitenancy</li>
  <li>Create seed files</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the project you choose and the requirements that develop, you may also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Allow users to upload files to your application</li>
  <li>Consume an external API</li>
  <li>Build an internal API</li>
  <li>Use JavaScript to access an API and/or update your page dynamically</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-roles--responsibilities"><a name="roles"></a> Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h3>

<p>The project will be worked on by teams of four to five developers over the span of two weeks.</p>

<p>You will name a team lead that will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work with the client to establish team priorities.</li>
  <li>Make sure business requirements are transformed into <a href="supporting_docs/user_stories">user stories</a>.</li>
  <li>Seek clarification from the client when a user story is not clear.</li>
  <li>Make sure that all the team members are on track and collaborating following an agreed upon <a href="supporting_docs/git">Git workflow</a>.</li>
  <li>Create a new Rails project on GitHub and invite team members and instructors as collaborators.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like all projects, individual team members are required to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Seek out features and responsibilities that are uncomfortable.</li>
  <li>Support your teammates so that everyone can collaborate and contribute.</li>
  <li>Follow a professional workflow when developing a feature.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-sprint-2-the-spin-off"><a name="sprint-1"></a> Sprint 2 (the spin-off)</h3>

<p>You will be assigned new groups and a project from a previous cohort for the second sprint. You will responsible for forking the project, deploying, and continuing to add features. The scope of what you add will be approved by your product owner.</p>

<h2 id="-typical-project-requirements"><a name="requirements"></a> Typical Project Requirements</h2>

<p>Students are responsible for developing user stories based on functionality they’d like to build with a goal of working on features that are of interest to them. However, instructors must approve of these stories prior to working on them. Progress will be monitored over the course of the sprints with daily stand-ups. See the Technical Requirements section below if you are curious about what kind of scope and technologies you might use.</p>

<p>You will work with your client to identify their business needs, and afterwards you will transform these requirements into user stories. To the degree that there is any ambiguity or misunderstanding of client requests, you will be responsible for scheduling a check-in to course correct. We also recommend that you work to use these check-ins to manage client expectations. For the purpose of this project, assume that your client does not have any programming experience. Technical questions can be asked during stand ups and at any other time.</p>

<p>High level cards associated with client requested features should be labeled as such so that they are easily identifiable on your project management tool. When you believe you have completed a feature, move it into the correct state. Depending on your client, they may require that they accept that card and verify that it is working on the production site before they accept it (work this out with your product owner). The stories as written and prioritized in your project management tool will be the authoritative project requirements. They may go against and likely go beyond the general requirements outlined below.</p>

<p>As the stories clearly define the client’s expectations, your application needs to <strong>exactly</strong> follow the stories as they’ve been developed with your customer. A 95% implementation is wrong. If you want to deviate from the story as it’s written, you need to discuss that with your client and get approval to change the story <em>before implementing on the production site</em>.</p>

<p>If in the course of implementing a feature you create smaller cards, assume that you can move those cards to “Done” on your own.</p>

<h3 id="-general-technical-requirements"><a name="general"></a> General Technical Requirements</h3>

<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>

<p>One of the main learning goals of this project is to give you the opportunity to develop a web application that supports multitenancy. To that end, each user of your application should have their own unique URL pattern: http://example.com/:username or http://example.com/:company_name/employees.</p>

<p>Before your final evaluation, your project should have a decent amount of seeded data (adjust according to what makes sense):</p>

<ul>
  <li>1000 total registered users</li>
  <li>5 - 10 postings per user</li>
  <li>1 platform administrator with the following user info:
    <ul>
      <li>Username: admin@admin.com</li>
      <li>Password: password</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It creates a much stronger impression of your site if the data is plausible. You could use the <a href="https://github.com/stympy/faker">Faker</a> gem to randomly create categorized data.</p>

<h4 id="user-types">User types</h4>

<p>Your app should allow the following user interactions:</p>

<h4 id="guest-user">Guest User</h4>

<p>As a guest, I should be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Browse public content / profiles.</li>
  <li>Log in or create an account.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="registered-user">Registered User</h4>

<p>As a registered user, I should be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Post listings or content either publicly or privately.</li>
  <li>Manage my account information.</li>
  <li>Manage my profile / content.</li>
  <li>“Comment” in some capacity (may be in the form of a “review” depending on your app’s domain).</li>
  <li>Utilize two-factor authentication using SMS confirmation via <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest">Twilio’s REST API</a> for a user to reset their password. In order to implement this feature, a phone number should be a required field for a user when they sign up.
    <ul>
      <li>You must generate and track the code in your database and not use a third party for this.</li>
      <li>Mild: Use the Twilio gem.</li>
      <li>Spicy: Don’t use the gem and hand roll your own HTTP wrapper around Twilio’s REST API without the use of external tools except a Ruby HTTP library.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="platform-admin">Platform Admin</h4>

<p>As a platform admin, I should be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Take a user offline / online, including all content associated with them but without removing the user or any of their data from the database.</li>
  <li>delete postings/content.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-specific-technical-requirements"><a name="specific"></a> Specific Technical Requirements</h3>

<h2 id="sprint-1---individual-evaluation">Sprint 1 - Individual Evaluation</h2>

<p>Each member of your team will commit to a story that demonstrates understanding of core concepts covered at Turing so far while also taking on a technical challenge that is outside of your comfort zone. The story will be determined with your instructor. At the end of the first sprint, each group will meet with their product owner and each member will demo their story.</p>

<p><strong>Each student should show up to your eval with a self assessed evaluation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Client Expectations</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Student delivered user story agreed upon with client.
    <ul>
      <li>4: Better than expected</li>
      <li>3: As expected</li>
      <li>2: Below expectations</li>
      <li>1: Well below expectations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Test Quality</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Story is well-tested (Above 90% and the most valuable pieces of the app are covered). If you were paying for someone to build this for you, would you be satisfied with the tests that are written?
    <ul>
      <li>4: Better than expected</li>
      <li>3: As expected</li>
      <li>2: Below expectations</li>
      <li>1: Well below expectations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Code Quality</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Project demonstrates well-factored code and a solid grasp of MVC principles.
    <ul>

      <li>2: Below expectations</li>
      <li>1: Well below expectations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bonus</strong></p>

<p>We want to recognize and reward risk-taking and exploration. Sometimes other areas might suffer if the risk doesn’t pan out. Earn a bonus point to offset a score above.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Did the team push themselves by taking risks?
    <ul>
      <li>1: Yes</li>
      <li>0: No</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Student Evaluation</strong></p>

<p>Each group member will evaluate each member of the group anonymously based on the criteria below. Students will receive the average score combined from all group members. 3 and above is considered passing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Communication
    <ul>
      <li>4: Group member did all the things mentioned in the bullet point below, but also was a catalyst for communication with the whole group.</li>
      <li>3: Group member communicated clearly when they would and wouldn’t be available well ahead of time. It was clear what they were working on and what the status was.</li>
      <li>2: Group member would communicate when they would or wouldn’t be available, but not until the last minute, or they would miss deadlines and not notify the group until the last minute.</li>
      <li>1: It was unclear what the group member was working on, or they would fail to notify the team when they weren’t going to meet a commitment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Group member contributed code (quantity and quality)…
    <ul>
      <li>4: above expectations.</li>
      <li>3: as expected.</li>
      <li>2: below expectations.</li>
      <li>1: well below expectations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
