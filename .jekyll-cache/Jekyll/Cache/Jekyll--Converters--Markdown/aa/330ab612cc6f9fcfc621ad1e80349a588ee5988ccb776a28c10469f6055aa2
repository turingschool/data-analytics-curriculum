<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<ul>
  <li>There are two benefits to testing - validation and design.
    <ul>
      <li>Validation - Does the software do what it is supposed to do?</li>
      <li>Design - Documents what the code does. Helps determine what software should do and how you know it works.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-dont-people-like-testing">Why Don’t People Like Testing?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Tests don’t run like normal code.</li>
  <li>Extra things associated with DSL (domain-specific language) to learn.</li>
  <li>Testing feels like a different method of execution, it’s a different paradigm.</li>
  <li>Testing compels you to make hard decisions early, and up front.
    <ul>
      <li>This is scary because you are making decisions in a context you don’t understand.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Testing (especially in the context of TDD) is a discipline tool – forces you to a) be <strong>specific</strong> about what you are trying to do and b) stay <strong>focused</strong> on that objective</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="testing-process--isolating-functionality">Testing Process – Isolating Functionality</h3>

<ul>
  <li>What makes a test easy to write? What makes it hard?
    <ul>
      <li>Being specific with the behavior you’re testing makes writing the test easier.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Can we identify the input?</li>
  <li>Can we identify the output?</li>
  <li>The “interface”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-essence-of-testing--asking-questions">The Essence of Testing – Asking Questions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Programming can be conceptually draining</li>
  <li>TDD is a discipline that forces us to answer “What am I trying to do?” with the “how” behind it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="workshop---questions--decisions">Workshop - Questions &amp; Decisions</h2>

<p>Let’s think about <em>the questions that lead to decisions</em>. Pair up with another student for one of the following short exercises.</p>

<p>For each exercise, you’ll be given a technical prompt describing an application you will be writing.
Imagine that you are beginning development of the project, and create a list of the <em>questions</em> that you’d have to answer in the context of writing your first few tests.</p>

<p>For each question, describe:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the question?</li>
  <li>Why do we need to answer this question <strong>now</strong> (at the first stages of development)?</li>
</ul>

<p>Questions can be a mix of the <strong>conceptual</strong>, like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>**Question**: Should we try to handle all the tags at once or one at a time? If the latter, which one should be first?
**Why we need to answer this now**: We need to know which part of the solution to start our implementation with.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the more <strong>specific</strong>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>**Question**: What will the class be named?
**Why we need to answer this now**: I can't write a first test without instantiating an object and need the classname to call `.new` on it.

Question: Where should we put our first file?
**Why we need to answer this now**: We can't write code until we have a file to put it in.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As a pair you should be able to come up with at least 10 questions.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Question: ...
**Why we need to answer this now**: ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="markdown-parser">Markdown Parser:</h3>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>We're writing a markdown parser that can take in a line of markdown and output a line of HTML. For instance:

  This is *a sample* with some **emphasis**.

Which in HTML form is:

  &lt;p&gt;
    This is &lt;em&gt;a sample&lt;/em&gt; with some &lt;strong&gt;emphasis&lt;/strong&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="lecture---mindsets-and-types-of-tests">Lecture - Mindsets and Types of Tests</h2>

<h3 id="2-mindset-approach">2-Mindset Approach</h3>

<h3 id="general-discipline--process-discussion">General Discipline / Process Discussion</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Why is it especially hard to get started on a development project?</li>
  <li>What is the point of a development process or technique (not a code technique but a workflow / process one)?</li>
  <li>We sometimes describe some dev processes or techniques as playing “mind games” with ourselves – can you think of any?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tdd-mindgames--the-two-mindset-approach">TDD Mindgames – The Two-Mindset Approach</h3>

<p>TDD Wants to help us solve some of these problems and get moving on our software projects. It’s helpful to think of it in
terms of 2 mindsets – at each phase of the work we want to place ourselves in one of the mindsets and stay focused on the task
that embodies.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mindset 1
    <ul>
      <li>Low Visibility</li>
      <li>High Exposure</li>
      <li>Everything is possible.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mindset 2
    <ul>
      <li>Has to deal with Mindset 1.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mindset 1 writes the test.</li>
  <li>Mindset 2 makes what Mindset 1 wants to happen a reality.</li>
</ul>

<p>These two mindsets have to work independently. Mindset 1 cannot deal with the details of how to make things happen.</p>

<h3 id="hierarchy-of-tests">Hierarchy of Tests</h3>

<p><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html">TestPyramid</a></p>

<p><img src="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/testPyramid/test-pyramid.png" alt="TestPyramid" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Unit</li>
  <li>Integration</li>
  <li>Feature</li>
  <li>Acceptance</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Unit Test</em> - tests one component in isolation.</p>

<p><em>Integration Test</em> - tests multiple interdependencies or coordinating components.</p>

<p><em>Feature Test</em> - a single feature as experienced by a user.</p>

<p><em>Acceptance Test</em> - a collection of user functionalities that delivers business value.</p>

<p>Feature and Acceptance Tests are customer-centric while Unit and Integration Tests are programmer-centric.
Especially when you move into web development projects in later modules you’ll rely more heavily on Acceptance and
Feature tests to verify the behavior of your application as it will eventually be experienced by a user.</p>

<p>In Module 1, on the other hand, we will rely much more heavily on <strong>Unit</strong> and <strong>Integration</strong> tests – and it’s very
important to have a good mix of both!</p>

<h2 id="workshop">Workshop</h2>

<p>Let’s think about <em>a hierarchy of tests</em>. Pair up with another student for this exercise. Given this technical problem:</p>

<p>Imagine that you are beginning development of the project. Create a list of tests following the idea of hierarchy we just discussed.</p>

<p>For now, focus on <strong>Unit</strong> and <strong>Integration</strong> tests. Try following this format:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Type: Unit
Question: How will we parse a single emphasis marker within a line or markdown?
Why: A line of Markdown may have an emphasis
Input: Markdown like "this is *a sample*"
Output: HTML like "this is &lt;em&gt;a sample&lt;/em&gt;"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As a pair you should be able to come up with at least four tests for each level.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> – Don’t be afraid to identify additional, <em>smaller</em> components that might exist in your system. For example you might identify a component to help split your document into separate tokens, etc etc. This kind of brainstorming is very helpful at the outset of a project, even if all of the components you imagine don’t end up making it into the final design.</p>

<h3 id="markdown-parser-1">Markdown Parser</h3>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>You're writing a whole Markdown processor which takes in complete Markdown files and outputs full HTML files.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="closing--tdd-workflow-recap">Closing – TDD Workflow Recap</h3>

<ul>
  <li>What are you trying to build? Why?
    <ul>
      <li>You would be well-served to write a sentence on what you are building and why.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How will you know when it works?
    <ul>
      <li>Acceptance tests are written by the stakeholder and are the last test to pass.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What’s the smallest/simplest representation of the input? Take, for example, this representation of a sorting algorithm:
    <ul class="task-list">
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />=&gt; [ ]</li>
      <li class="task-list-item">[1] =&gt; [1]</li>
      <li class="task-list-item">[1,5] =&gt; [1,5]</li>
      <li class="task-list-item">[5,1] =&gt; [1,5]</li>
      <li class="task-list-item">[1,5,6] =&gt; [1,5,6]</li>
      <li class="task-list-item">[6,5,1] =&gt; [1,5,6]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is the input needed by the program?</li>
  <li>What are the processes / steps needed to be taken?</li>
  <li>Are the results correct?</li>
</ul>
