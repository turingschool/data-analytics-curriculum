<h3 id="warmup---5-minutes">Warmup - 5 Minutes</h3>

<p>Break into groups of three near your current seat. At least one person needs to tell a story.</p>

<p>Here are some prompt ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Think of the closest you’ve come or succeeded at getting arrested.</li>
  <li>Think of your longest day.</li>
  <li>Think of the furthest you’ve ever been from home.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="full-group-discussion-human-stories--interaction">Full-Group Discussion: Human Stories &amp; Interaction</h3>

<p>The concrete facts of a plot don’t make a story interesting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Kids crash land on an island, argue, and some die as they recreate the problems of adult society.”</li>
  <li>“Young woman and man meet on a ship. It sinks. He dies.”</li>
  <li>“Hackers fuck up the perfect paradise that computers built for them for no real gain.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="energy-of-a-story">Energy of a Story</h4>

<ul>
  <li>What makes a story? Characters, Conflict, Change, Resolution, Hierarchy, Focus</li>
  <li>Experience story elements (Conflict, Change, Resolution) via characters</li>
  <li>Characters struggle and change through conflict (person v person, person v environment, person v themselves)</li>
  <li>The “state” of a character throughout the story – how are they feeling,
where are they, etc</li>
  <li>Characters take action – their choices and behaviors drive the story</li>
  <li>Characters <strong>Interact</strong> – Think about a play – the entire story is
driven by dialogue (relevant <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AlanKayOnMessaging">quote from Alan Kay</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="linking-to-object-oriented-programming">Linking to Object-Oriented Programming</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Identify the “characters” – what things are we interested in</li>
  <li>Give our characters the ability to develop over time – what are their
attributes, their “state”</li>
  <li>Let our characters “act” – give them behaviors and use those behaviors
to drive the change</li>
  <li>Let our characters “interact” – develop systems gradually by defining the key
elements and connecting them over time</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="programming-stories">Programming Stories</h2>

<p>Let’s talk about the big picture ideas of Object Oriented programming:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>objects</strong> and <strong>conversations</strong></li>
  <li><strong>messages</strong> and <strong>responses</strong></li>
  <li>the <strong>class</strong> definition</li>
  <li>creating <strong>instances</strong> of a class</li>
  <li>writing our own <strong>language</strong></li>
  <li>how to <strong>write a method</strong></li>
  <li>how to <strong>accept an argument</strong> and <strong>use it</strong></li>
  <li>the concept of a <strong>call stack</strong></li>
  <li>the role of <strong>attributes</strong></li>
  <li>creating <strong>instance variables</strong> to store <strong>attribute values</strong></li>
  <li>combining it all together</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="concepts-exploration-hamlet---10-minutes">Concepts Exploration: Hamlet - 10 Minutes</h3>

<p>Let’s talk about Shakespeare’s Hamlet. If you were going to implement Hamlet in code, you would have to have a Horacio class, and then you would have to instantiate it.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Horacio</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">h</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Horacio</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Whatever it means to be Horacio, you would define in the class, and then create an instance of the class. This is
the idea of Horacio-ness and you would create one Horacio from that mold.</p>

<p>Contrast that with something like a generic guard:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Guard</span>
  <span class="nb">attr_reader</span> <span class="ss">:name</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="vi">@status</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="ss">:guarding</span>
    <span class="vi">@name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">name</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">march</span>
    <span class="vi">@status</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="ss">:marching</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">halt</span>
    <span class="vi">@status</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="ss">:guarding</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">current_status</span>
    <span class="vi">@status</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">g1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Guard</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"A Guard Has No Name"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">g2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Guard</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"A Guard Also Has No Name"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">g3</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Guard</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"A Guard Still Has No Name"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">g1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">name</span>
<span class="n">g3</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">name</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">g1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">g2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">g3</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">each</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">g</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">march</span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="n">g2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">current_status</span>
<span class="n">g1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">current_status</span>
<span class="n">g1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">halt</span>
<span class="n">g1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">current_status</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When items are unique and important, we will have a single class that gets instantiated one time.</p>

<p>Other times we are going to create general forms and create multiple instances of them. They are not the same, they have some uniqueness, but they more or less have the same form.</p>

<p>In the example above, all of the guards may be able to stab, or call for help, but they may have unique attributes such as names, heights, and weapons.</p>

<h4 id="classes-vs-instances">Classes vs. Instances</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Question: “why create a class for Horacio?”</li>
  <li>Only one Horacio in the play, why do we need to be able to “copy” him?</li>
  <li>Remember in OO – objects are the key – they model state and behavior</li>
  <li>The ability to grow and change over time – i.e. develop throughout the play</li>
  <li>Each play only has 1 Horacio, but he still needs to be able to develop during
the arc of that story</li>
  <li>The next time we tell the story we need to start again – fresh Horacio, new
development</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="building-a-car">Building a Car</h2>

<p>Let’s think about modeling cars in code. Work through these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Car</code> class and save it in <code class="highlighter-rouge">car.rb</code>.</li>
  <li>At the bottom of the file, outside the class definition, write <code class="highlighter-rouge">my_car = Car.new</code> to create an instance.</li>
  <li>Run the file from your terminal with <code class="highlighter-rouge">$ ruby car.rb</code>. Observe nothing (boohoo!).</li>
  <li>Add a method to the class named <code class="highlighter-rouge">horn</code>. In that method return the String <code class="highlighter-rouge">"BEEEEEP!"</code>. Then at the very bottom of the file add <code class="highlighter-rouge">puts my_car.horn</code>. If you’re using Seeing Is Believing, you can omit the <code class="highlighter-rouge">puts</code>, that will print it so that you can see it from the terminal, but you don’t need to do that if you’re using SiB.</li>
  <li>Run your file again and observe output (yay!).</li>
  <li>Add a method to your class named <code class="highlighter-rouge">drive</code> which takes an argument named <code class="highlighter-rouge">distance</code>. When the method is called, have it return the a string like <code class="highlighter-rouge">I'm driving 12 miles</code> where <code class="highlighter-rouge">12</code> is the value passed in for <code class="highlighter-rouge">distance</code>.</li>
  <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">puts my_car.drive(12)</code> to the bottom of your file and run it again. Observe two lines of output (double yay!).</li>
  <li>Add an <code class="highlighter-rouge">attr_accessor</code>, an externally-accessible attribute, with the name <code class="highlighter-rouge">color</code>.</li>
  <li>Add a method named <code class="highlighter-rouge">report_color</code> that returns the String <code class="highlighter-rouge">"I am purple"</code> where <code class="highlighter-rouge">"purple"</code> is the value stored in <code class="highlighter-rouge">color</code>.</li>
  <li>Add two lines to the bottom of the file: <code class="highlighter-rouge">my_car.color = 'purple'</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">puts my_car.report_color</code></li>
  <li>Add an externally-accessible attribute named <code class="highlighter-rouge">wheel_count</code> and add a line at the bottom setting it to <code class="highlighter-rouge">18</code>.</li>
  <li>At the bottom of the file, write a line that prints out <code class="highlighter-rouge">"This sweet ride is sitting on 18 wheels"</code> where <code class="highlighter-rouge">18</code> is the value returned from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">wheel_count</code> method.</li>
  <li>At the bottom of the file, write a line that creates a second instance of the class Car called, <code class="highlighter-rouge">my_second_car</code>, and sets the <code class="highlighter-rouge">wheel_count</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">2</code>. Then write a line that prints “This sweet ride is sitting on 2 wheels”. Observer how the two instances have their own instance variables (one car has 18 wheels, the other has 2 wheels, the code is shared through the class, but the variables are stored on the object).</li>
  <li>This one is tricky. Add a method named <code class="highlighter-rouge">start</code>. If the car has not yet been started, when the method is called it should return <code class="highlighter-rouge">"Starting up!"</code>. But if the car has previously been started, it should return <code class="highlighter-rouge">"BZZT! Nice try, though."</code>. You’ll need to create an instance variable, a method, use an if statement, and return a value.</li>
</ol>

<p>Tonight please <a href="https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/poodr.markdown">complete Part 1 of POODR</a>.</p>

<h2 id="going-further-optional">Going Further (optional)</h2>

<p>If you get done with all of the above, then follow along with <a href="https://vimeo.com/137837005">this</a> video.
It will go through <a href="https://github.com/JoshCheek/1508/blob/0facae943f7785e5133ea506595534c1b00b3025/katas/blowing_bubbles_part2.rb">this</a> coding exercise.
It builds on bubble sort, but you don’t have to understand the algorithm to follow along with it
It only plays with swapping representations, not changing behaviour.
We’ll take a piece of top-level procedural code and turn it into a beautiful namespaced object,
and then back again.</p>
