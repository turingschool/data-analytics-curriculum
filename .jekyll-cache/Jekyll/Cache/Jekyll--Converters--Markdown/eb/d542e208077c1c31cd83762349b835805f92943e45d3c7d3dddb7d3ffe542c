<h2 id="warmup">WarmUp</h2>

<ul>
  <li>How have you already implemented refactoring strategies in your code?</li>
  <li>Whatâ€™s a key distinction between changing code and refactoring?</li>
  <li>Recall yesterdayâ€™s red-green-refactor example. What are some strategies to get your code back to green again after you refactor and your tests run red?  (a.k.a. how do you refactor without breaking everything?)</li>
  <li>What are three reasons for refactoring your code?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="refactoring-strategies">Refactoring Strategies</h2>

<p>Three highlighted refactoring patterns from Jay Fields revised Fowlerâ€™s book for Ruby:
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Edition-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Series/dp/0321984137">Refactoring: Ruby Edition</a></p>
<ol>
  <li>Move Method</li>
  <li>Extract Class</li>
  <li>Hide Delegate</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Turn &amp; Talk</strong>
What is the gist of each of these refactoring patterns? What are the pros/cons of each?</p>

<h2 id="stations">Stations</h2>

<p>You will spend 15 min at each station focusing on one of the strategies.
For each station you will apply the refactoring pattern to the code from <a href="https://github.com/turingschool-examples/refactoring_patterns">this</a> repo. Make sure to clone it down before you start.</p>

  <li>The readings we used today can be <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4C6lfVKu-E7ZlFDTnhyTklXdm8/view?usp=sharing">found here</a>. Read through the refactoring patterns not covered in this lesson.</li>
  <li>Apply the techniques practiced today to a sample Enigma project; work through <a href="https://github.com/turingschool-examples/enigma_refactoring_exercises">these exercises</a>. The first should be tackled alone &amp; if possible, the second exercise should be done with a partner.</li>
