<p>In this tutorial we’ll introduce HTTP and build a number guessing game we can play through a web browser.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>The internet, which for most people is the web…how does that work?</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Internet</strong> is the network between devices that allows them to exchange information</li>
  <li>Devices fall in to two categories: <strong>Clients</strong> and <strong>Servers</strong>.</li>
  <li>Clients send <strong>Requests</strong> to Servers asking for some kind of information</li>
  <li>Upon receiving a Request, Servers send <strong>Responses</strong> back to the Client</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HTTP</strong> is a set of rules for how this exchange of information happens. Clients and Servers adhere to these rules to ensure that they understand each other’s Requests and Responses.</p>

<p>Imagine you’re writing to a penpal. The process would look something like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write a letter</li>
  <li>Specify your penpal’s address</li>
  <li>Drop the letter in your mailbox</li>
  <li>The letter goes through the postal system and arrives at your penpal’s mailbox</li>
</ol>

<p>Your penpal then goes through a very similar set of steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Read your letter and write a response</li>
  <li>Specify your address</li>
  <li>Drop their letter in their mailbox</li>
  <li>The letter goes through the postal system and arrives at your mailbox</li>
</ol>

<p>In this metaphor:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are the <strong>Client</strong></li>
  <li>Your penpal is the <strong>Server</strong></li>
  <li>Your letter is the <strong>Request</strong></li>
  <li>Your penpal’s letter is the <strong>Response</strong></li>
  <li>The postal system, the thing responsible for ensuring your letters are delivered, is <strong>The Internet</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HTTP</strong> is the language you write in so that your penpal can understand you. You may write in English because you know you both understand English. If you wrote a letter in Spanish and your penpal only spoke English, they might write you a letter back saying “Please write to me in English”.</p>

<p>Metaphor aside, let’s run through the protocol as executed by computers:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You open your browser, the Client, and type in a web address like <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://turing.io</code> and hit enter.</li>
  <li>The browser takes this address and builds an <strong>HTTP Request</strong>. It addresses it to the Server located at <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://turing.io</code>.</li>
  <li>The Request is handed off to your Internet Service Provider (ISP) (like CenturyLink or Comcast) and they send it through the Internet, mostly a series of wires and fiber optic cables, to the Server</li>
  <li>The Server reads the Request. It knows how to read it because it is formatted as an <strong>HTTP Request</strong>.</li>
  <li>The Server generates an <strong>HTTP Response</strong> to that Request.</li>
  <li>The server hands the Response off to their ISP and it goes through the internet to arrive at your computer.</li>
  <li>Your browser reads the Response. It knows how to read it because it is formatted as an <strong>HTTP Response</strong>.</li>
  <li>Your browser displays the data on your machine.</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s HTTP. At its core, it is a bunch of formatting rules that Clients and Servers use to talk to each other. You can read more on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">wikipedia page</a> or the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616">IETF specification</a>.</p>

<h2 id="starting-a-server">Starting a Server</h2>

<p>In this tutorial, we will play the part of both the Server and Client. We will write the server in Ruby, and we will use a web browser, like Chrome or Safari, as the Client.</p>

<p>Add the following lines of code to a Ruby file:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Library that contains TCPServer</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'socket'</span>

<span class="c1"># Create a new instance of TCPServer on Port 9292</span>
<span class="n">server</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">TCPServer</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">9292</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Run the file with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ruby &lt;filename&gt;</code> and you should see that nothing happens. So what do these lines of code do?</p>

<p>TCPServer is the Class we will use to create a new Server.</p>

<p>9292 is the <strong>Port</strong> that the Server runs on. The Port uniquely identifies a program running on a computer. Back to our penpal analogy, imagine your penpal lives in a large apartment building. You have to specify both the street address and the apartment number. In HTTP, we have to specify both the Server and the program within the Server we want to send our Request to.</p>

<p>Nothing is special about the Port we specified, 9292. It is just a number. You could just as easily change this number to 8181. There are some Ports that are special, however. Change the Port from 9292 to 1, run the file, and see what happens.</p>

<p>Update the file like so:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Library that contains TCPServer</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'socket'</span>

<span class="c1"># Create a new instance of TCPServer on Port 9292</span>
<span class="n">server</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">TCPServer</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">9292</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># Wait for a Request</span>
<span class="c1"># When a request comes in, save the connection to a variable</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s1">'Waiting for Request...'</span>
<span class="n">connection</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">server</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">accept</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The last line is telling the server to wait for a Request. When our server gets a Request, we are saving the connection to a variable called <code class="highlighter-rouge">connection</code>. This connection is an open door between our Server and Client that the Server will use to read the Request and send back the Response. If you run the file now, you should see <code class="highlighter-rouge">Waiting for Request...</code> printed to your terminal which then hangs. Success! Your Server is now running. Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">ctrl + c</code> to stop the Server.</p>

<h2 id="address-in-use-errors">Address In Use Errors</h2>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ctrl + c</code> gracefully ends our program, but sometimes things happen that make our program exit not so gracefully. One of these things is using <code class="highlighter-rouge">ctrl + z</code>. <strong>DO NOT</strong> use <code class="highlighter-rouge">ctrl + z</code>! This could result in the Port not being released, and you may at some point see an error like this:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Address already in use - bind(2) for nil port 9292 (Errno::EADDRINUSE)</code></p>

<p>If you get that error enter this command into your terminal:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>lsof -i:9292
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and you should get output that looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>COMMAND   PID  USER       FD   TYPE            DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
ruby    63015 username    8u  IPv6  0xc5b438446726a53      0t0  TCP *:armtechdaemon (LISTEN)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Take that number under <code class="highlighter-rouge">PID</code>, in this case 63015, and enter:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>kill -9 63015
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Run your server file again and everything should be okay.</p>

<h3 id="reading-the-request">Reading the Request</h3>

<p>Update your file to look like this:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Library that contains TCPServer</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'socket'</span>

<span class="c1"># Read the request line by line until we have read every line</span>

<span class="n">line</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">connection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">gets</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">chomp</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">line</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">empty?</span>
  <span class="n">request_lines</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">line</span>
  <span class="n">line</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">connection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">gets</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">chomp</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="c1"># Print out the Request</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">request_lines</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Run your file again and you should see your terminal hanging. Open up a web browser, like Google Chrome, and enter the following into the address bar:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">localhost:9292</code></p>

<p>Your terminal should print out the Request text similar to the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:9292
Connection: keep-alive
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_13_2) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/66.0.3359.139 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using Google Chrome, it may send two requests. The first one is the one we are concerned with. Ignore the second one requesting the “favicon”.</p>

<p>What we just did was start a Server and tell it to wait for a Request. Then we sent a Request using a web browser. When our Server got the Request, it read it and printed it out to the screen line by line.</p>

<p>What got printed to the screen is the <strong>HTTP Request</strong>. It is just a highly formatted string. Let’s break down this Request:</p>

<p>The first line is called the <strong>Request Line</strong>. It contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Verb</strong>, in this case <code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code>. The Verb indicates what type of Request are you sending. <code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code> is the most basic HTTP Verb. A Get Request is just asking for information. In this tutorial, we will only be concerned with GET Requests.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Path</strong>, in this case <code class="highlighter-rouge">/</code>. The Path specifies where the request should go. Together, the first two words are saying “Get me the information located at <code class="highlighter-rouge">/</code>”.</li>
  <li>The Protocol, in this case <code class="highlighter-rouge">HTTP/1.1</code>. It specifies which version of the HTTP protocol we are using.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the following lines are <strong>Headers</strong>. The first word is the name of the Header, and everything after is the value of the Header. The first Header is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">host</code> header that has a value of <code class="highlighter-rouge">localhost:9292</code>. Notice that this is very similar to a Hash. These Headers are unimportant for this tutorial, but other types of Requests may put critical information in the Headers.</p>

<h3 id="generating-the-response">Generating the Response</h3>

<p>Now that our Server has gotten a Request, we need to send back a Response. Update your file with the following:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Library that contains TCPServer</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'socket'</span>

  <span class="n">line</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">connection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">gets</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">chomp</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="c1"># Print out the Request</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">request_lines</span>

<span class="c1"># Generate the Response</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Sending response."</span>
<span class="n">output</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"&lt;html&gt;Hello from the Server side!&lt;/html&gt;"</span>
<span class="n">status</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"http/1.1 200 ok"</span>
<span class="n">response</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">status</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="se">\r\n</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="se">\r\n</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">output</span>

<span class="c1"># Send the Response</span>
<span class="n">connection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">puts</span> <span class="n">response</span>

<span class="c1"># close the connection</span>
<span class="n">connection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">close</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Run this file and send a Request to <code class="highlighter-rouge">localhost:9292</code> from the browser just like before. You should see the text <code class="highlighter-rouge">Hello from the Server side</code> in your browser. We now have a successful Client/Server interaction!</p>

<p>Let’s break down our response:</p>

<p>The variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">output</code> is the information we want to send to the Client. In our case, it is some HTML with a short message.</p>

<p>The variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">status</code> is required by the HTTP protocol. It indicates what the result of the request was. <code class="highlighter-rouge">200 ok</code> is the most common status. It means everything is fine. Another common status you’ve probably seen is <code class="highlighter-rouge">404 not found</code>. There are many, many different HTTP status codes.</p>

<p>Together, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">status</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">output</code> make the request. Notice there needs to be two <code class="highlighter-rouge">\r\n</code>s joining the status and the output. These blank lines are an example of how the HTTP Request needs to be formatted properly so that our Client can read it. Try just putting one <code class="highlighter-rouge">\r\n</code> in between them and see what happens.</p>

<p>When we are done writing the Response, we need to close the connection.</p>

<p>After your Server sends a response, the program ends. If you try to send to refresh the page, you won’t get a connection. Let’s update our code so that the Server will continually accept Requests:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Library that contains TCPServer</span>

<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You should now be able to refresh the page multiple times and get a Response every time.</p>

<h2 id="playing-the-guessing-game">Playing the Guessing Game</h2>

<p>Now we want to use our server to play a number guessing game. In order to make this work, we can’t just request information from the Server. We have to also send it some information, in this case the guess. We do that with parameters. Parameters are extra information attached to the Path Header. They are specified using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">?</code>. We want to be able to send a guess like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>localhost:9292?guess=50
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When your server gets a Request like this, it will see the Path as <code class="highlighter-rouge">/?guess=50</code>. We need to extract the guess and report back whether the guess was correct, too low, or too high.</p>

<p>Update your code with the following:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Library that contains TCPServer</span>
