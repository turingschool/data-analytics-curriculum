<p>It is valuable for you and your team to dedicate time <strong>during</strong> and <strong>after</strong> a project to have a retro. During this time, you should reflect on the project, communication, and teamwork that has occurred thus far. Use this reflection to inform how your next sprint can continue doing what is well and improve from what youâ€™ve learned. Create a gist and use the questions below to guide your retro.</p>
