<h3 id="feedback-tests-our-growth-mindsets">Feedback Tests Our Growth Mindsets</h3>
<p>Review: what is a growth mindset? How do you think feedback might affect a growth mindset?</p>

<p>Pulse Check: How much does this sound like you? Reflect in your journals on these statements:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>To What Degree is this Me?</th>
      <th>Never, Occasionally, Sometimes, Often, Always</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>I love feedback.</td>
      <td>1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>I recognize when I have feedback triggers.</td>
      <td>1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>I separate how Iâ€™m feeling from the feedback.</td>
      <td>1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>I view tough situations as learning opportunities.</td>
      <td>1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>I reward myself when I get something helpful from feedback because of the way I handled it.</td>
      <td>1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Turn &amp; Talk:</strong>
Turn to the person next to you to discuss your reflections on the above statements. How do you and your partner feel similarly or differently about these statements?</p>

<p><strong>Whole Group Debrief:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>What did you and your partner have in common about these statements?</li>
  <li>How did you differ?</li>
  <li>Based on this discussion, where would you like to see a change in your attitude towards feedback?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="right--wrong-spotting">Right &amp; Wrong Spotting</h3>
<p>When we receive feedback, often our first reaction is that itâ€™s wrong or unhelpful. Thatâ€™s a valid feeling resulting from a trigger and the impact that the feedback has on you â€“ go with it. Pay attention to why youâ€™re having this impact.</p>

<p><strong>In the moment:</strong>
Hone in on your internal voice to pay attention to what could be triggering you:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Internal Voice</th>
      <th>Listen For:</th>
      <th>Ask:</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>TRUTH</strong><br />Thatâ€™s wrong.<br />Thatâ€™s not helpful.<br />Thatâ€™s not me</td>
      <td><strong>Data</strong> they have that I donâ€™t and interpretations they have that are different from mine<br /><strong>Impacts</strong> Iâ€™m hearing that I may not be aware of because of my blind spots</td>
      <td>Can you give me an example?<br />What did that mean to you?<br />What are your concerns?<br />What do you see me doing thatâ€™s getting in my own way?<br />How did that affect you?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>RELATIONSHIP</strong><br />After all Iâ€™ve done for you?<br />Who are you to say?<br />Youâ€™re the problem, not me.</td>
      <td><strong>Changing the topic</strong> to the relationship<br /><strong>Systems</strong> between us; what each of us is contributing to the relationship tensions</td>
      <td>Help me understand your feedback then I want to talk about some of my relationship concerns.<br />What do you see me contributing to the problem between us?<br />What is most upsetting to you and why?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>IDENTITY</strong><br />I screw up everything.<br />Iâ€™m doomed.<br />Iâ€™m not a bad person, am I?</td>
      <td><strong>My wiring:</strong> how sensitive I am to feedback and how quickly I recover<br /><strong>Opportunities</strong> for me to sort through for coaching; what I can use for growth and learning</td>
      <td>Help me put your feedback in perspective with how you view me overall.<br />What could I do that would help me improve?<br />What could I change that would matter most to you?</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Upon further reflection:</strong>
Use the Right &amp; Wrong Spotting Technique to turn the feedback into something useful. Start by listing everything that seems wrong about the feedback. And then go back through the feedback and pull out what might be <em>right</em> about it â€“ what truth is there in this feedback? What is something that you can easily implement?</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Wrong</th>
      <th>Right</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What do I not agree with about this feedback?</td>
      <td>What is something right that I can use from this feedback?</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4 id="i-do">I Do</h4>
<p>Allison will model how she would use the Right &amp; Wrong Spotting technique to parse through feedback.</p>

<h4 id="you-do">You Do</h4>
<p>Spend 10 minutes reflecting on feedback that youâ€™ve received recently. Create a right and wrong spotting table and write out any questions that you have still to clarify that feedback further. Youâ€™ll need to make sure to ask these questions from your previous partners later!</p>

<h3 id="johari-windows">Johari Windows</h3>
<p>Created by psychologists Joseph Luft and Harrington Ingham in 1955 (and named for them, combining the names Joe and Harry), the Johari Window is a technique used to help people better understand their relationship with themselves and others.</p>

<p>Complete the <a href="./johari_window_activity">Johari Window activity</a> using the adjectives you and your teammates identified for you ahead of time. Create your own copy of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IFaKPTEA3V96i8cboxqeAfgKEyEbigwIxQ5KQ-lp440/edit?usp=sharing">Johari Window</a>.</p>

<p>Analyze:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What do you notice about each quadrant?</li>
  <li>For the Blind Spot quadrant, is there anything youâ€™d like to build more awareness around? How will you do that?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="you-do-1">You Do</h4>
<p>Spend 15 minutes creating your Johari Windows and then the last 10 minutes of this practice time on <a href="./feedback_implementation_strengths_reflection">your reflection</a>. Keep in mind that youâ€™ll be coaching each other in the next part of the lesson.</p>

<h3 id="appreciative-inquiry">Appreciative Inquiry</h3>
<p>Appreciative Inquiry is a coaching technique that is focused on bringing about positive change. It is based on the idea that human beings move in the direction of what we ask about, and if we deliberately ask positive questions around affirmative topics, such as core values, peak experiences, best practices, and worthy accomplishments, we can ignite constructive dialogue and inspire action within organizations, communities, and individuals.</p>

<p>Today weâ€™ll use the 5D approach to appreciative inquiry to unearth ways you can apply the feedback youâ€™ve been given. Instead of trying to figure out problems need to be solved from this feedback, Appreciative Inquiryâ€™s underlying assumption is that people are full of assets, capabilities, resources, and strengths that can be located, affirmed, leveraged, and encouraged.</p>

<p>The Appreciative Inquiry model follows this 5D approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Definition - selecting the right topic</li>
  <li>Discovery - focusing on the best within that topic domain</li>
  <li>Dream - envisioning possibilities</li>
  <li>Design - creating prototypes of what should be</li>
  <li>Destiny/Delivery - innovating and improvising fresh solutions</li>
</ul>

<p><em>For more on Appreciative Inquiry and why itâ€™s helpful in professional development, check out this <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettsteenbarger/2015/06/21/appreciative-inquiry-leading-by-asking-the-right-questions/2/#1a104b293767">article</a>.</em></p>

<p>Here are some examples of Appreciative Inquiry questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are you doing well right now, according to the data from you and your peers?</li>
  <li>What feedback can you use to reenergize your approach to pairing practices?</li>
  <li>Who are you when youâ€™re functioning at your best?</li>
  <li>Tell me about a peak experience when you were functioning at your best without worrying about how others would approve or evaluate you, knowing you were doing your very best work.</li>
  <li>What factors allow you to be most successful, and how can you create these circumstances?</li>
  <li>What is your personal mission for what you want from your professional development?</li>
  <li>What have you already learned that you can leverage and amplify?</li>
  <li>What in your past successes provides the information that will help you be even more successful/creative/wise/powerful in the future?</li>
  <li>When you think of your best self and where youâ€™d like to go with your professional development, what is one step you want to take to get there?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="you-do-2">You Do</h3>
<p>Find a partner for coaching practice. Coaching practice will follow this pattern:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spend 1 minute deciding on 3-4 questions from the above list that you want your partner to ask you; you can also generate your own questions.</li>
  <li>Partner A asks questions of Partner B for 5 minutes. Partner A should ask any follow-up questions that can help clarify what Partner B is saying. Partner B should take notes on any takeaways.</li>
  <li>Switch - Partner B asks questions of Partner A for 5 minutes. Partner B should ask any follow-up questions that can help clarify what Partner A is saying. Partner A should take notes on any takeaways.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="goal-setting">Goal-Setting</h3>
<p>Take what you learned from your Appreciative Inquiry conversations to create some goals for yourself. Consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As you finish up Module Two, what do you want to keep doing and what changes would you like to make?</li>
  <li>As you look ahead to Module Three, what do you want to accomplish? How will you do that?</li>
  <li>As you think about your upcoming job search, how will you approach it using what you do best?</li>
  <li>Envision that itâ€™s a year from now. What is different in your life? How did you make that happen? What is the same and why?</li>
</ul>
