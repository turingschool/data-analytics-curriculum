This link talks about running a local production environment and ensuring that <code class="highlighter-rouge">config.public_file_server.enabled = true</code> inside <code class="highlighter-rouge">production.rb</code> is set. This is done in my application and did not solve my issue.</li>

  <li>Example: github.com/user_name/repo_name
I followed the instructions posted here to run my production environment: https://gist.github.com/rwarbelow/40bd72b2aee8888d6d91
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Add gem 'rails_12factor' to your Gemfile. This will add error logging and the ability for your app to serve static assets.
bundle
Run RAILS_ENV=production rake db:create db:migrate db:seed
Run rake secret and copy the output
From the command line: export SECRET_KEY_BASE=output-of-rake-secret
To precompile your assets, run rake assets:precompile. This will create a folder public/assets that contains all of your assets.
Run RAILS_ENV=production rails s and you should see your app.
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>I have tried clobbering my assets and running the precompile command again.</p>
