<p>You need things done like new siding on your house or a vintage couch reupholstered. New business owners and side tinkerers want more work.
Let’s create a platform that connects professionals to projects in a way that encourages people to stay honest.</p>

<h3 id="specific-requirements">Specific Requirements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>User roles should include: guest, professional, requester, admin.</li>
  <li>Professionals should be able to publicly post profiles of their skills.</li>
  <li>Requesters should be able to publicly post work they need done on their property.</li>
  <li>Both professionals and requesters should be able to message each other to discuss the project including sending images of the work that needs to be done and PDFs of estimates.</li>
  <li>Once a project is assigned to a professional, it should no longer be listed publicly.</li>
  <li>Requesters should be able to see all projects they’ve listed.</li>
  <li>Professionals should be able to see all work they’ve applied for (with differentiation for projects they’ve been assigned to).</li>
  <li>To keep both professionals and requesters honest, each can rate each other. (polymorhic association)</li>
  <li>Only professionals can see a requester’s rating.</li>
  <li>Professionals should only see requests for jobs they have the skills to complete. (i.e. A seamstress probably shouldn’t see a request for siding)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="possible-extensions">Possible Extensions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Integrate a 3rd party API for online payments.</li>
