    <ol>
      <li>How did your pairing exercise go last week when the pairs didn’t have the same background knowledge?</li>
      <li>Consider that most of your pairing up to this point has been with people with similar expertise to your own. What will it be like on the job if your team uses pair programming?</li>
      <li>What do you think it takes for a pair to be successful collaborators?</li>
      <li>What do you do if a pairing goes off track?</li>
