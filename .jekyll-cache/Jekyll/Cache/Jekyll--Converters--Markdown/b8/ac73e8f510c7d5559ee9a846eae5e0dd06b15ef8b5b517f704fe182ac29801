<h2 id="ruby-file-io-commands-in-action">Ruby File I/O commands in Action</h2>
<p>Work with a partner next to you to do the following:</p>

<p>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">cat</code> to create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">quiet_quotes.txt</code> from the command line and paste the following into it:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Bob Ross Quotes
â€œWe don't make mistakes, just happy little accidents.â€
â€œTalent is a pursued interest. Anything that you're willing to practice, you can do.â€
â€œThere's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.â€
â€œI guess Iâ€™m a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. Thatâ€™s okay though; I have more fun than most people.â€
â€œAll you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind.â€
â€œThe secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe.â€
â€œI started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do.â€
â€œMix up a little more shadow color here, then we can put us a little shadow right in there. See how you can move things around? You have unlimited power on this canvas -- can literally, literally move mountainsâ€
â€œLet's build a happy little cloud. Let's build some happy little trees.â€
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using <code class="highlighter-rouge">ARGV</code>, write a Ruby script that will take in the above file and write out an all caps version to <code class="highlighter-rouge">loud_quotes.txt</code>.</p>

<p>The program must be executed from the command line like so:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ruby &lt;filename.rb&gt; quiet_quotes.txt loud_quotes.txt
</code></pre></div></div>
