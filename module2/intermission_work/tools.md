## Install Postico

https://eggerapps.at/postico/

This is a tool that will make it much easier to navigate your local databases and build/run SQL commands.

## Install Chrome

If you are currently using another browser, download and install Chrome [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/). This will make it so that we can share shortcuts and have a consistent experience when debugging together as a class.
