For the project eval, you should come prepared for a 10 minute presentation of your code to an evaluator.

The technical presentation portion is outlined below with what points should be covered. **You should be able to present on all points even if you did not implement in code.**  If you have questions about the presentation, please let an instructor know before the evaluation day.

You should review each section of the rubric and strive to have a 3 in each section before attempting any 4s.
