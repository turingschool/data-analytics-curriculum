## Context

The US housing boom had the conditions for a perfect storm. After seeing the constant increase in housing prices, regular people started investing in the housing market. Given the surge in demand for mortgages, lending institutions reduced their criteria to approve more loans. To increase eligibility, lending institutions designed mortgages that had an interest rate that increased every year. Investors saw this as an opportunity to buy a house, let its price increase, and sell it with a profit.

However, in 2005, foreclosures started to increase. People with mortgages with increasing interest rates started to default on their payments. In 2005, over 885,000 foreclosure notices were filed. A year later, this number rose to 1.25 million, a 41 percent increase.

The mortgage foreclosures created a systemic failure. First, they reduced the demand for housing purchases, which in turn, lowered the price of houses. Second, this decrease in housing value made it harder for people to refinance existing mortgages. Third, people who could no longer flip or afford their houses started defaulting more. Finally, the lending institutions, which had borrowed a significant amount of money to multiply their returns (leverage), faced unprecedented losses causing a global financial crisis.

## Overview

DannyMay, a mortgage lender, wants to develop a better system to assess the risk of its applicants. The company barely survived the 2008 financial crisis, and after a change of CEOs, it wants to reduce its exposure to bad loans. DannyMay investors will unlock the next round of financing based on the progress made in the upcoming quarter. Therefore, this initiative is the CEO's top priority.

To fulfill this request, the Risk Analysis Department has tasked you with assessing the risk of hundreds of applicants. This, they expect, will let them have a preliminary model that will improve DannyMay's balance sheet. You'll be presenting your findings to the Head of the Risk Analysis Department.
