Black Thursday
===============

A business is only as smart as its data. Let's build a system to manage our data and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerce business.

Project Overview
-----------------

### Learning Goals

*   Use tests to drive both the design and implementation of code
*   Decompose a large application into components
*   Design a solution that is functional, readable, maintainable, and testable
*   Learn an agile approach to building software

### Getting Started

1.  One team member forks the repository [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/black_thursday) and adds the other(s) as collaborators.
1.  Everyone on the team clones the repository
1.  Setup [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) to monitor test coverage along the way
1.  Setup [Hound CI](https://houndci.com/)
1.  Create a Rakefile

#### Special Notes

This project will require you to be running version 2.5.x of Ruby. This will get you used to working in an older version of Ruby and you will learn how to work with different versions of Rubies using rbenv.

Documentation for rbenv can be found [here](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/blob/master/README.md)

### Spec Harness

This project will be assessed with the help of a [spec harness](https://github.com/turingschool/black_thursday_spec_harness). The `README.md` file includes instructions for setup and usage. Note that the spec harness **is not** a replacement for your own test suite.

Spec harness `README.md` [here](https://github.com/turingschool/black_thursday_spec_harness)

### Key Concepts

From a technical perspective, this project will emphasize:

*   File I/O
*   Database Operations (CRUD)
*   Encapsulating Responsibilities
*   Light data / analytics

### Project Iterations and Base Expectations

Because the requirements for this project are lengthy and complex, we've broken
them into Iterations in their own files. Your project *must* implement iterations 0 through 4. Iteration 5 is the Undiscovered Country.

*   [Iteration 0](./iteration_0) - Merchants & Items
*   [Iteration 1](./iteration_1) - Beginning Relationships and Business Intelligence
*   [Iteration 2](./iteration_2) - Basic Invoices
*   [Iteration 3](./iteration_3) - Item Sales
*   [Iteration 4](./iteration_4) - Merchant Analytics
*   [Iteration 5](./iteration_5) - Customer Analytics
