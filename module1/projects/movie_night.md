Streaming services such as [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com), [Hulu], [Disney+] and [HBO Max](https://www.hbomax.com) have become the dominant force in the industry. The largest service, Netflix, had a total net income of over [USD$2.76 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272561/netflix-net-income/) and a revenue of USD$25 billion, in 2020. 

To maintain their preeminence, streaming services allocate significant resources to create new content. This content, in turn, drives customers onto the streaming services increasing subscriptions, improving retention, and creating more user data. This data is then used by streaming services to predict consumer trends, produce new content, and recommend additional shows for customers.

These were the investments made in 2020:

* Netflix ($16 billion)
* Amazon ($7 billion)
* Apple ($6 billion)
* Hulu ($3 billion)
* Disney+ ($1.75 billion)
* HBO ($1.5 billion)

Therefore, to maximize their return on investment, streaming services need to understand customer preferences to improve their competitive edge and increase their revenue.
