## Submission and Project Demo

This project will be evaluated in two ways:

* Project Demo
* Asynchronous Instructor Code Review

When you are finished, make sure your code is pushed up to your master branch on your repository on Github. Send a link to your repository to all instructors in a Slack direct message.

### Project Demo

Each pair will demo their finished game for a small group of your classmates.  During the demo, you will be asked to do the following:

* Play your game
* Walk through the code that you implemented to validate ship placement
* Show a diagram and briefly describe your classes and how they interact. This can be a drawing on the board.

Your demos should be 10 minutes with an additional 5 minutes for questions from the audience.

### Asynchronous Code Review

After the project demos, the instructors will provide feedback on your code through the project [rubric](./rubric).
