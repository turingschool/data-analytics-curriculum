## Context

The [RMS Titanic](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) was a British passenger ship and the largest ship afloat at the time it entered service. In its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City, the Titanic hit an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on April 15th, 1912. Of an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, only around 700 survived. The sinking is the deadliest peacetime sinking of a cruise ship to date.

The Titanic had advanced safety features according to the safety regulations of those days. The ship had [davits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davit) that could lower 48 lifeboats —three at a time— but only carried 20 lifeboats. These boats could carry 1,178 people or about half the number of people on board. When the Titanic sank, the lifeboats were only half-filled.

## Overview

In this project, you will analyze the passenger data of the RMS Titanic and find insights related to the accident. To achieve this, you will need to import the data to **Jupyter** notebooks; use **Python**, **Numpy**, and **Pandas** to explore the data; and create a report with your findings. At the end you will submit your Jupyter notebook with your findings on a repository on **Github**.

## Vocabulary

* **CSV**: comma-separated values, a text-based file format that is commonly used for storing and transferring tabular records.
* **Python**: an object-oriented general-purpose programming language that emphasizes code readability. It is used mainly for data-related tasks, web development, and automation.
* **Anaconda**: a Python and R distribution for scientific programming that simplifies package management and deployment.
* **Jupyter**: an initiative to develop open-source systems for interactive computing. The two most used Jupyter products in Data Analysis are JupyterLab, a web-based interactive development environment, and Jupyter Notebooks, a web-application that allows users to create documents that contain live code.
* **Numpy**: a Python package for scientific computing. It used to perform mathematical operations on arrays such as those in Trigonometry, Statistics, and Algebra.
* **Pandas**: a Python package for data manipulation and analysis. It offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

## Learning Goals

At the end of this project, students will be able to:

* Install Anaconda.
* Install Python packages using Anaconda.
* Use Jupyter notebooks to explore data and write reports.
* Use Pandas to load data into dataframes.
* Use Numpy to create series objects.
* Use Matplotlib to create data visualizations.
* Use Seaborn to create data visualizations.
* Create objects to manipulate data programmatically.
* Use variables to store data.

## Requirements

To start working on this project, you will need to install Anaconda and download the RMS Titanic passenger data set. To install Anaconda follow the instructions [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). You can download the data set [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). The data provides information such as age, class of ticket and sex; It contains 891 rows and 12 columns.
