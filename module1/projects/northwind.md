## Context

Food distribuition is one the most important industries in the United States. There are about 33,000 establishments with a combined revenue of $670 billion. The 50-largest companies, such as [McLane Company](https://www.mclaneco.com), [Supervalu](https://supervalu.ie), [Sysco Corp](https://www.sysco.com), and [US Foodservice](https://www.usfoods.com), generate 50% of the food distribution revenue.

Knowing your customers is key to food distributors' success. The demand of their products is highly dependent on changes in demographics and customer preferences. While largest distributors focus on bulk purchasing and economies of scale, smaller companies compete by specializing in certain products or specific geographical areas.

Supermarkets, restaurants, and convenient stores are responding to changing customer preferences by offering more varied, more practical, and more natural products. This is forcing food distributors to deliver a broader offering more frequently. Dot Foots, for instance, recently launched more than 100 different natural specialty manufacturers to respond to this changes. In this competitive environment, food distributors must use data to identify changing consumer trends and opportunities to reduce waste and improve the efficiency of their operations.

## Overview

In this project, you will analyze the data of a food distributor in the United States and find insights related to customers, employees, products, and revenue. To setup the project, you will need to create a database and import the data. As in the last project, you will use **Jupyter**, **Python**, and **Pandas**, but you will also use **Seaborn** to create visualizations, and **SQL** to query the data in the database. At the end you will submit your Jupyter notebook with your findings on a repository on **Github**.

## Vocabulary

* **Revenue**: an organizational income before expenses. The difference between revenue and profit, is that revenue doesn't account for expenses, while profit does.
* **Database**: an organized collection of data stored electonically in a computer system that supports storage and manipulation. There are different types of databases, but mostly they are divided in relational and non-relational.
* **ERD**: Entity Relationship Diagram, a visual representation of how different sets of data (entities) in a database relate to each other.
* **SQL**: Structured Query Language, a domain-specific programming language used to access and manipulate relational databases such as Postgresql, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.
* **Seaborn**: a Python data visualization library based on **matplotlib**. It is used to draw statistical graphics.

## Learning Goals

At the end of this project, students will be able to:

* Create advanced level aggregations.
* Implement subqueries, views, and common table expressions
* Design visualizations using Seaborn.
* Use joins to find data in different tables.
* Calculate business metrics, such as revenue, to deliver business value.
* Translate business requests into insights.
* Create, restore, and connect to a database.
* Use Entity Relational Diagrams to map out relationships between data sets.
* Query data using dates.

## Requirements

To start working on this project, you will to download the [Postgres App](https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html), install the **Postgres CLI Tools**, and setup the project database.

## Submission

You will submit your findings via a repository on **Github**. The repository will be named `<first name>-<last name>-northwind`. The repository should contain your Jupyter notebook.
