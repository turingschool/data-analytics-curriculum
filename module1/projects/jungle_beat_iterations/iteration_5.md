# Iteration 5 - Creating the JungleBeat Linked List "Wrapper"

Awesome! We have built most of our program and now it's time to wrap the Linked List logic in a `JungleBeat` class.

When we create a new instance of the `JungleBeat` class, a `LinkedList` object is also instantiated and available as an attribute on the `JungleBeat` instance. Now, we can manage our linked list through the `JungleBeat` class.

Up until now, we have only been able to `append` and `prepend` a single node at a time. The LinkedList class hasn't formatted the data it received, consequently, passing the string "deep bop dop" to `append` has resulted in _one_ node created with data `deep bop dop`. With `JungleBeat` as an extra layer, it can take care of properly formatting the data (eg: splitting the string) before passing it down to the `LinkedList`. This implementation results in _three_ nodes appended to the list if we pass the string "deep bop dop" to `JungleBeat#append`.

Expected behavior:

```ruby
> require "./lib/jungle_beat"
> jb = JungleBeat.new
=> <JungleBeat list=<LinkedList head=nil #234567890890> #456789045678>
> jb.list
=> <LinkedList head=nil #234567890890>
> jb.list.head
=> nil
> jb.append("deep doo ditt")
=> "deep doo ditt"
> jb.list.head.data
=> "deep"
> jb.list.head.next_node.data
=> "doo"
> jb.append("woo hoo shu")
=> "woo hoo shu"
> jb.count
6
```
