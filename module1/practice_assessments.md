## Practice Paired Assessment

* [Pets and Customers](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/pets_and_customers)

## Practice Independent Challenges

**Week 2**

The week 2 challenge is an intro to Object Oriented Programming. It will require students to build two classes that interact, as well as use an enumerable.

Example: [Potluck](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/potluck)

**Week 3**

The week 3 challenge will require students to build three classes that interact. It will also involve a more complex enumeration problem that can't be solved with a single enumerable. Students will also need to access a Hash.

Example: [World Cup](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/world_cup)

**Week 4**

The week 4 challenge will involve three classes with only partial specifications. Students must think algorithmically to build an Object Oriented solution that solves the problem. Students will also be required to build a hash.

Example: [Boat Rental](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/boat_rental)
Example: [Colorado Lottery](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/colorado_lottery_2003)

**Weeks 5 and 6**

The week 5 and 6 challenges are a test of a student's knowledge of OOP and Ruby mechanics. They will involve two or three classes that interact, iterating over a hash, and several methods that can't be built with a single enumerable.

The week 5 challenge will be a practice for the final in week 6.

Example: [Reunion](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/reunion)
Example: [Museo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/museo)
